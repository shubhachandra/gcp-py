JIRA Story: GCP Routing & Connectivity Audit for Misconfigurations and Open Paths

Title:
GCP Routing & Connectivity Audit for Misconfigurations and Open Paths

Description:
As a Network Security Engineer, I want to perform an in-depth audit of GCP subnet routing paths to identify misconfigurations, detect unintentional open paths to the Internet, and flag redundant or conflicting routes, so that I can ensure network security, compliance, and optimal connectivity.

⸻

Acceptance Criteria (Including Required GCP Tools):
	1.	Subnet Routing Analysis
	•	Use Cloud Asset Inventory to collect and analyze all subnet routing paths.
	•	Identify any unexpected or misconfigured routes that could impact connectivity.
	•	Ensure all routes follow organizational policies and best practices.
	2.	Detection of Unintentional Open Paths to the Internet
	•	Utilize Cloud Security Command Center (SCC) and VPC Flow Logs to detect routes that unintentionally expose resources to the public Internet.
	•	Use Cloud Logging & Cloud Monitoring to track network activity and flag security violations.
	•	Generate alerts and reports on any exposed subnets.
	3.	Redundant & Conflicting Route Identification
	•	Use VPC Network Connectivity Center to visualize routing paths and detect redundant or conflicting routes.
	•	Cross-check Cloud Asset Inventory data to identify duplicate or conflicting entries.
	•	Suggest corrective actions to optimize routing.
	4.	Automated Reporting & Compliance Checks
	•	Use Cloud Logging & Security Command Center (SCC) to generate a structured report highlighting misconfigurations and recommended fixes.
	•	Ensure compliance with internal security policies and GCP networking best practices.
	5.	User Review & Documentation
	•	Conduct a review session with the networking team using reports from VPC Flow Logs and Cloud Monitoring.
	•	Provide documentation on how to interpret and resolve flagged routing issues.
	•	Incorporate feedback for continuous improvement and update Terraform configurations if necessary.

Story Points Estimate:
	1.	Subnet Routing Analysis – 3 Points
	2.	Detection of Unintentional Open Paths – 5 Points
	3.	Redundant & Conflicting Route Identification – 3 Points
	4.	Automated Reporting & Compliance Checks – 3 Points
	5.	User Review & Documentation – 2 Points

Total: ~16 Story Points (adjustable based on team discussion).

This format integrates both the audit tasks and GCP tool requirements directly into the acceptance criteria for clarity. Let me know if you need any refinements!
