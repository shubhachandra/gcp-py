JIRA Story for Subnet Inventory & Mapping Using Network Connectivity Center

Title:
Subnet Inventory & Visual Mapping Using Network Connectivity Center

Description:
As a Network Administrator, I want to generate a comprehensive inventory of all subnets across the environment and visualize their associated network paths using Google Cloud Network Connectivity Center, so that I can better understand and manage network topology, connectivity, and potential issues.

Acceptance Criteria:
	1.	Subnet Inventory Generation
	•	List all subnets across the cloud environment.
	•	Capture metadata such as region, VPC, CIDR, associated firewall rules, and route tables.
	•	Ensure data accuracy and completeness.
	2.	Network Connectivity Center Integration
	•	Configure Network Connectivity Center to display visual network mapping.
	•	Verify that all subnets and interconnectivity paths are represented accurately.
	•	Ensure live updates and visibility into subnet changes.
	3.	Visualization & Reporting
	•	Validate that the subnet inventory can be exported (e.g., CSV, JSON).
	•	Provide a detailed mapping report within the Google Cloud Console.
	•	Document any missing or misconfigured network paths.
	4.	Security & Compliance Check
	•	Ensure permissions and IAM roles are correctly assigned for viewing and managing Network Connectivity Center.
	•	Validate compliance with networking policies.
	5.	User Testing & Documentation
	•	Conduct a review session with key stakeholders.
	•	Provide documentation on how to interpret the subnet mapping.
	•	Address any feedback or necessary changes.
