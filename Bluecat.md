Here’s a table that summarizes the required Google Cloud Organization Policy constraints to enable GCP Marketplace solution deployment, including the constraint name, description, required action, and how to enable them at the project level:

Name	Constraint	Description	Required Action	How to Enable at Project Level (Terraform Snippet)
Allow External IPs	constraints/compute.vmExternalIpAccess	Controls whether VMs can be assigned external IPs	Must allow (unset or allow specific accounts)	hcl<br>resource "google_project_organization_policy" "ext_ip" {<br>  project = "your-project-id"<br>  constraint = "constraints/compute.vmExternalIpAccess"<br>  restore_policy {<br>    default = true<br>  }<br>}
Allow Public Image Projects	constraints/compute.trustedImageProjects	Restricts VM images to trusted projects (affects Marketplace images)	Must include vendor image projects	hcl<br>resource "google_project_organization_policy" "trusted_images" {<br>  project = "your-project-id"<br>  constraint = "constraints/compute.trustedImageProjects"<br>  list_policy {<br>    allow {<br>      values = ["projects/bluecatnetworks-public"]<br>    }<br>  }<br>}
Allow API Enablement	constraints/serviceuser.services	Restricts enabling/disabling of GCP APIs	Must allow required services	hcl<br>resource "google_project_organization_policy" "allow_services" {<br>  project = "your-project-id"<br>  constraint = "constraints/serviceuser.services"<br>  restore_policy {<br>    default = true<br>  }<br>}
Allow External Load Balancers	constraints/compute.restrictLoadBalancerCreationForTypes	Restricts creation of specific load balancer types	Must allow EXTERNAL if solution requires	hcl<br>resource "google_project_organization_policy" "load_balancer" {<br>  project = "your-project-id"<br>  constraint = "constraints/compute.restrictLoadBalancerCreationForTypes"<br>  list_policy {<br>    allow {<br>      values = ["EXTERNAL"]<br>    }<br>  }<br>}
Allow IP Forwarding (Network Appliances)	constraints/compute.vmCanIpForward	Controls whether VMs can forward packets (needed for some network appliances)	Must allow (unset or explicitly allow)	hcl<br>resource "google_project_organization_policy" "ip_forwarding" {<br>  project = "your-project-id"<br>  constraint = "constraints/compute.vmCanIpForward"<br>  restore_policy {<br>    default = true<br>  }<br>}
Allow Required IAM Domains	constraints/iam.allowedPolicyMemberDomains	Restricts IAM members to specified domains (can block vendor service accounts)	Must allow vendor domains or leave unset	hcl<br>resource "google_project_organization_policy" "iam_domains" {<br>  project = "your-project-id"<br>  constraint = "constraints/iam.allowedPolicyMemberDomains"<br>  restore_policy {<br>    default = true<br>  }<br>}
Allow Marketplace Procurement API	constraints/cloudcommerceprocurement.Purchasing	Controls if users can purchase Marketplace products	Must allow Marketplace usage (unset or allow)	hcl<br>resource "google_project_organization_policy" "marketplace" {<br>  project = "your-project-id"<br>  constraint = "constraints/cloudcommerceprocurement.Purchasing"<br>  restore_policy {<br>    default = true<br>  }<br>}
