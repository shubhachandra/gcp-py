The demarcation for non-routable addresses, as mentioned, is set using 100.0.0.0/10. We have defined four SDLC environments—Core, Non-Prod, Prod, and Sandbox—for each region (us-central1, us-east1, us-south1, us-east4), with a /15 subnet allocated for SDLC in each region.

As per the current demarcation, I am reserving 50% of the subnet space in each SDLC environment for each region. Based on historical usage of assigned subnets:

/24 is utilized around 5-6%,
/25 accounts for 10% of the usage,
80% of the requests are for /26.
I have prepared the subnet allocation accordingly.
