Team Utilization and Roadmap Showcase

Completed:

Addressed IP overlaps; structured clear subnet demarcation across regions.

Transitioned subnet provisioning to Ops team, boosting Network team's productivity.

Established groundwork for Palo Alto implementations and IPAM alternatives.

In Progress:

NIC Project: Reclaim unused IP CIDRs (inactive >3 months).

Future Plans:

Optimize network infrastructure to reduce latency.

Expand focus on strategic network engineering.

Build comprehensive network utilization dashboard using advanced analyzers.

Establish a safety net for subnet expansions and future demands.

Build new US region (us-region), specifically "us-south" to support US workloads efficiently and reduce latency between on-premises and cloud resources.

Completed:

Developed Python script to verify subnet availability.

Facilitated subnet creation handover to Operations team.

Provided a robust alternative to Infoblox-IPAM tool.

Created comprehensive documentation and knowledge transfer (KT).

Delivered demo video for seamless adoption by Operations team.

Work in Progress:

Post-Sentinel policy rollout: Conducting BDD testing and modifying existing modules for compliance.

Planned:

Developing Terraform code for AD sandbox (physical separation).

Implementing ProdDiscovery VOC in QA-Ent environment (pending refinement).

Showcase: Sai Kumar's Work

Completed:

Successfully provisioned 9 subnets for various application teams: GDW, Pyfarm, Nonprod, SIT, Blade, and ADMF.

In Progress:

Continuing subnet provisioning for additional application team requests.

Future Plans:

Further streamline subnet provisioning processes for enhanced efficiency and scalability.
