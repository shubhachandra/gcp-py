Guide Operations Team on Resolving Authentication and Connectivity Errors with Python Scripts

Description:

The operations team might encounter authentication and connectivity errors when executing the Python scripts. To proactively resolve this, they should follow the outlined configuration process:

Create a new configuration.

Set the appropriate username.

Set the certificate PEM file. (Best practice: Copy the PEM file to the download environment and replace the user ID.)

Ensure authentication via gcloud auth login.

Ensure application default login with gcloud auth application-default login before running the script.

Tasks:

Task 1: Reach out to the operations team, guide them through the configuration process, and collect evidence of successful execution.

Task 2: Document the configuration steps and update the relevant Confluence page.

Task 3: Create an FAQ section in Confluence addressing common errors and troubleshooting steps related to script execution.
