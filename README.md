Thanks! Here's an updated version of the email with your note about the fix for versions 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 — and that the issue still persists.

**Subject:** Continued IAM Binding Limit Issues Post 4.2.1/4.2.2 Fix – Request for Group Migration Approval

Hi \[Recipient's Name],

We are still encountering **HTTP 400 errors** due to **IAM policy binding member limits** (exceeding the 1500-member cap at the host VPC project level), even after applying the **4.2.1 and 4.2.2 fixes**.

As previously advised, we’ve communicated to the application teams to:

* Run `terraform init --upgrade` before applying any changes.
* Avoid using the UI for Terraform version upgrades. Instead, they should clone the codebase, execute `terraform init --upgrade`, and apply changes via CLI.

### Long-term Resolution:

To resolve this at scale, we propose **migrating direct IAM role bindings of service accounts to pre-approved groups**, especially for service accounts with the `roles/compute.networkUser` role at the host VPC project level.

Typical service accounts per project include:

* Cloud Services Service Agent
* Notebooks Service Agent
* Terraform Service Account (`tf-service`)

By moving these accounts to respective groups that already hold the required `compute.networkUser` role, we expect to **free up approximately 650 IAM bindings**.

Additional contributors to the binding limit:

* **Composer**: Uses the **Shared VPC Agent** role, which adds around **274 bindings**. We propose grouping these service accounts similarly.
* Other roles to consolidate via groups:

  * `roles/vpcaccess.user` (Serverless VPC Access)
  * `roles/container.hostServiceAgentUser` (GKE Host Service Agent)

### Request:

Kindly **approve the proposed group names** so we can proceed with this optimization. This change is critical to ensure continued stability and scalability of IAM configurations.

Please let us know if you require the full mapping of service accounts to groups or if you'd prefer a quick discussion to finalize.

Best regards,

To optimize IAM bindings at the host VPC project level, we are creating dedicated Google Groups to manage role assignments more efficiently:

A group (<GROUP_NAME_FOR_COMPUTE_NETWORK_USER>) will be created to assign the roles/compute.networkUser role. This group will include:

Cloud Service Agents (service accounts ending with @cloudservices.gserviceaccount.com)

Notebooks Service Agents (ending with ggc-sa-notebooks.iam.gserviceaccount.com)

Terraform service accounts (tf-<sdlc>-<appid>.iam.gserviceaccount.com)

A group (<GROUP_NAME_FOR_COMPOSER_SHARED_VPC_AGENT>) will be created for Composer Shared VPC Agent roles, consolidating Composer service agents that currently have individual bindings.

A group (<GROUP_NAME_FOR_SERVERLESS_VPC_ACCESS>) will be created for service accounts using the roles/vpcaccess.user role (Serverless VPC Access).

A group (<GROUP_NAME_FOR_CONTAINER_SERVICE_AGENT>) will be created for service accounts using the roles/container.hostServiceAgentUser role (GKE Host Service Agent).

These groups will be granted the required roles at the host project level, significantly reducing the total number of IAM bindings
