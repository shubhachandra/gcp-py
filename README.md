Subject: BigQuery Access from On-Premises â€“ Connectivity Modes and IP Whitelisting

Hi [Team/Network/Security Team],

Please find below the summary of available connectivity options for enabling communication between our on-premises applications and BigQuery, along with IP ranges for whitelisting.

â¸»

Connectivity Modes
	1.	Public Internet Access
	â€¢	Access BigQuery APIs over the public internet via HTTPS (bigquery.googleapis.com).
	â€¢	No fixed IP list available â€” Google uses dynamic ranges.
	â€¢	Recommended to allow outbound to *.googleapis.com over port 443 instead of IP-based whitelisting.
	2.	Private Connectivity via VPN / Interconnect + Private Google Access (PGA)
	â€¢	Provides private communication over existing VPN or Interconnect.
	â€¢	Enable Private Google Access or Restricted Google Access on the VPC subnet.
	â€¢	Whitelist IP ranges:
	â€¢	199.36.153.4/30 (Restricted Google Access)
	â€¢	199.36.153.8/30 (Private Google Access)
	â€¢	34.126.0.0/18 (Additional Google API range)
	â€¢	IPv6 equivalents: 2600:2d00:0002:1000::/64, 2600:2d00:0002:2000::/64, 2001:4860:8040::/42
	â€¢	Recommended for secure enterprise connectivity.
	3.	Private Service Connect (PSC) to Google APIs
	â€¢	Creates a private endpoint in GCP for Google APIs (including BigQuery).
	â€¢	On-prem traffic routes via VPN/Interconnect to the VPC, then through PSC to Google.
	â€¢	Whitelisting is required only up to the VPC endpoint; traffic beyond that remains internal to Googleâ€™s network.
	â€¢	Uses the same underlying IP ranges as Private Google Access.

Key Notes
	â€¢	All BigQuery access should use IAM-based authentication (service accounts or OAuth).
	â€¢	Whitelisting IPs for public internet mode is not reliable due to dynamic address changes.
	â€¢	Prefer Private Google Access or PSC for stable, secure connectivity.
	â€¢	All traffic uses HTTPS (port 443).
	â€¢	Periodically review Googleâ€™s published IP ranges for updates.

Recommended Approach:
Use Private Google Access or PSC through existing VPN/Interconnect links for secure, compliant, and stable BigQuery connectivity.

Would you like me to tailor this mail for your network/security team (formal version) or internal project documentation (slightly more technical version)?
