Subject (for email): Request for Approval & Guidance – BlueCat IPAM PoC Deployment in GCP Sandbox

Message:

Hi [Name],

We’re planning a short-term PoC to evaluate BlueCat IPAM in the GCP QA-ent sandbox environment. This solution aims to improve IP address management across our SDLCs and reduce ongoing issues like IP conflicts and CR delays.

The deployment involves:

A VM from GCP Marketplace (~USD 24.46/month)

Internal BYOL licensing (to be arranged separately)

I understand that we should have this proposal reviewed and approved by the Landing Zone team, especially since it involves provisioning and cost. Could you please help me understand the right process to move this forward—such as any intake forms, tickets, or required approvals?

Appreciate your support and guidance.
