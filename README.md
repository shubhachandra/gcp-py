| Service               | Recommended Subnet Size | Private Google Access | Cloud NAT Required (Private) | Additional Notes |
|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Cloud Composer      | /24 (Composer 2), /28 (Composer 1) | Yes | Yes | Required for communication with Cloud SQL and APIs. Enable firewall rules for IAP and API calls. |
| Cloud Dataproc      | /16 or /20 | Yes | Yes | Large subnet required for ephemeral VM instances. Needs firewall rules for cluster communication. |
| Cloud Dataflow      | /24 or larger | Yes | Yes | Private instances require NAT for API calls. Ensure firewall rules allow outbound communication. |
| Vertex AI Workbench | /24 or larger | Yes | Yes | Required for JupyterLab and ML model training. Needs firewall rules for SSH (22) and HTTPS (443). |
| Cloud SQL           | /24 or larger | Yes | Yes (if private IP) | Private IP Cloud SQL requires Private Google Access and VPC Peering for secure connections. |
| Cloud Storage       | N/A (Uses Googleâ€™s network) | Yes (for private VPC) | Yes (if private VPC) | No subnet required, but Private Google Access ensures secure API calls. |
| BigQuery           | N/A (Uses Googleâ€™s network) | Yes (for private VPC) | Yes (if private VPC) | No subnet required, but Private Google Access allows secure queries from private VPC. |
Detailed Subnet and Network Requirements for Each Service
1. Cloud Composer
Subnet Size: /24 (Composer 2) or /28 (Composer 1).
Private Google Access: Yes, required for API communication.
Cloud NAT: Yes, needed for internet-bound traffic from a private VPC.
Firewall Rules:
Allow IAP (Identity-Aware Proxy)
Allow communication with Cloud SQL (private IP enabled)
Allow egress traffic for external API calls.
2. Cloud Dataproc
Subnet Size: /16 or /20 (for large clusters).
Private Google Access: Yes, for accessing BigQuery, Cloud Storage, etc.
Cloud NAT: Yes, required for private clusters.
Firewall Rules:
Allow SSH (22) for admin access.
Allow ICMP for internal cluster health checks.
Allow TCP 9870, 8088, 10000, 7077, 8080 for internal services.
3. Cloud Dataflow
Subnet Size: /24 or larger (for scaling workers).
Private Google Access: Yes, for accessing Google APIs.
Cloud NAT: Yes, required for worker nodes in private networks.
Firewall Rules:
Allow outbound traffic to BigQuery, Cloud Storage, Pub/Sub, Spanner.
Allow internal communication among worker nodes.
Allow SSH (22) for debugging.
4. Vertex AI Workbench
Subnet Size: /24 or larger.
Private Google Access: Yes, for API calls and dataset retrieval.
Cloud NAT: Yes, required for internet-bound traffic.
Firewall Rules:
Allow SSH (22) for remote access.
Allow HTTPS (443) for JupyterLab UI.
Allow TCP 8080, 8085, 8443 for ML workloads.
5. Cloud SQL
Subnet Size: /24 or larger.
Private Google Access: Yes, needed if using private IP.
Cloud NAT: Yes, required if using private IP and need external communication.
Firewall Rules:
Allow MySQL (3306), PostgreSQL (5432), SQL Server (1433).
Allow egress traffic to application VPCs.
Ensure VPC Peering for private Cloud SQL.
6. Cloud Storage
Subnet Size: N/A (Uses Googleâ€™s network).
Private Google Access: Yes, required for access from a private VPC.
Cloud NAT: Yes, if accessing from a private VPC without public IPs.
Firewall Rules:
Allow HTTPS (443) for API communication.
Ensure IAM roles provide correct permissions.
7. BigQuery
Subnet Size: N/A (Uses Googleâ€™s network).
Private Google Access: Yes, required for querying from a private VPC.
Cloud NAT: Yes, required for secure API calls from private networks.
Firewall Rules:
Allow HTTPS (443) for API communication.
Ensure IAM roles for dataset access.
Summary
Private Google Access is required for all private services to communicate with Google APIs.
Cloud NAT is required for all private VPC setups that need outbound internet access.
Subnet size depends on scalability and service requirements (e.g., Dataproc needs larger ranges).
Firewall rules ensure internal and external communication security.
