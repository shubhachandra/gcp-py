RFC 1918 Address Usage in ad-Ent and qa-Ent Across SDLC

Overview

The following summarizes private IP address allocations (per RFC 1918) utilized within the ad-Ent and qa-Ent environments across various stages of the SDLC, including development, testing, staging, and production. This report aggregates the CIDR blocks used and presents them in a structured format for network planning and compliance reference.

⸻

1. 10.x.x.x Range (RFC1918)

These blocks are used heavily for internal development and QA workloads, particularly within isolated VPCs for SDLC environments.

CIDR Block	Description
10.0.0.128/25	Subnet for smaller environments or zones
10.0.1.0/24	Standard subnet used for QA services
10.0.2.0/23	Extended QA environments or test farms
10.255.255.0/24	Reserved for special edge cases or gateways



⸻

2. 172.16.x.x Range (RFC1918)

This range represents more structured allocations, often aligned to specific SDLC stages.

CIDR Block	IP Range Covered	Purpose
172.16.0.0/20	172.16.0.0 – 172.16.15.255	Base VPC block for ad-Ent dev environments
172.16.16.0/22	172.16.16.0 – 172.16.19.255	Staging environments
172.16.20.0/24	172.16.20.0 – 172.16.20.255	Functional test zones
172.16.21.0/26	172.16.21.0 – 172.16.21.63	Isolated test pods
172.16.21.64/27	172.16.21.64 – 172.16.21.95	Microservice component testing
172.16.21.96/28	172.16.21.96 – 172.16.21.111	Specialized service integrations



⸻

3. 172.21.x.x – 172.25.x.x Range (RFC1918)

These blocks are used for enterprise-level SDLC support, such as QA platforms, system simulations, and staging.

CIDR Block	Purpose
172.21.0.64/26	Small isolated subnet
172.21.0.128/25	General test bed
172.21.1.0/24	Extended QA zone
172.21.2.0/23	Integration or load testing
172.21.4.0/22	Larger subnet for scalable applications
172.21.8.0/21	App simulation environments
172.21.16.0/20	Platform-level resource allocations
172.21.32.0/19	Cross-functional team deployments
172.21.64.0/18	Shared services across SDLC
172.21.128.0/17	Non-prod mirror of prod
172.22.0.0/15	Staging and dry-run environments
172.24.0.0/14	Pre-production and user acceptance testing
172.25.0.0/17	Specialized QA scenarios
172.25.128.0/27	Isolated service or node testing
172.25.128.32/28	API mock endpoints
172.25.128.64/27	Canary testing
172.25.128.96/28	Final QA validation



⸻

Conclusion

The IP blocks listed here are all from RFC1918 private address space, reserved for internal use. This structured allocation across ad-Ent and qa-Ent ensures:
	•	Clear separation of concerns across SDLC stages
	•	Efficient routing within VPCs
	•	Security isolation between components and teams

This strategy also facilitates network observability, scalability, and future-proofing for on-prem/cloud hybrid SDLC setups.
