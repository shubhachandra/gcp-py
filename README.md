üí° Let‚Äôs break this down carefully based on your architecture:

‚∏ª

üåü Your setup
	‚Ä¢	Prod project ‚Üí Hosts Dialogflow CX API / service attachment (the service producer)
	‚Ä¢	Core project ‚Üí Handles VPC peering / PSC / on-prem connectivity (the service consumer + network hub)
	‚Ä¢	On-prem ‚Üí Connects via Core project (likely over Cloud Interconnect / VPN)

‚∏ª

üöÄ Why do you need these roles and where?

1Ô∏è‚É£ roles/pscauthorizedservice (in the prod project)

üëâ Purpose:
	‚Ä¢	The Dialogflow API in the prod project publishes a PSC service attachment.
	‚Ä¢	To restrict who can connect to it (which consumer projects/networks), someone (or some service account) must authorize the Core project‚Äôs VPC network to use this PSC endpoint.

üëâ Why does a service account in prod need this?
	‚Ä¢	Because the service account in prod is managing the Dialogflow API + PSC service attachment.
	‚Ä¢	That service account (or user) must have roles/pscauthorizedservice so it can update the list of authorized consumers (i.e., your Core project‚Äôs VPC network).

üëâ Example action:

gcloud compute service-attachments update <dialogflow-psc-attachment> \
  --consumer-accept-list=project=core-project-id,network=core-vpc


‚∏ª

2Ô∏è‚É£ roles/servicedirectory.networkAttacher (in the prod project)

üëâ Purpose:
	‚Ä¢	The Dialogflow service attachment typically gets registered in Service Directory in the prod project.
	‚Ä¢	You need to attach that Service Directory namespace to the Core project‚Äôs VPC (or the network through which consumers will resolve it).

üëâ Why does a service account in prod need this?
	‚Ä¢	The service account in prod is responsible for linking the namespace (that holds the Dialogflow endpoint) to the right VPC (Core project VPC).
	‚Ä¢	This enables private DNS resolution from the Core VPC.

‚∏ª

üìù Why doesn‚Äôt this role go to the Core project service account?
	‚Ä¢	The Core project service account is consuming the PSC service, not publishing it.
	‚Ä¢	It‚Äôs the producer‚Äôs responsibility (prod project) to:
	‚Ä¢	authorize consumers (via PSC)
	‚Ä¢	attach the service to networks (via Service Directory)

‚∏ª

üîë Summary

Role	Assigned in	Purpose
roles/pscauthorizedservice	Prod project service account	Authorize Core project VPC network to connect to Dialogflow PSC attachment
roles/servicedirectory.networkAttacher	Prod project service account	Attach Dialogflow Service Directory namespace to Core project VPC so services can resolve the name privately


‚∏ª‚úÖ OK, let‚Äôs restate what you‚Äôre doing:
	‚Ä¢	You have a seed service account (usually a bootstrap or automation account used in Terraform pipelines).
	‚Ä¢	This seed SA is managing IAM in multiple projects:
	‚Ä¢	Core host project (the networking hub)
	‚Ä¢	Prod project (where Dialogflow API lives)

You want to justify why the seed service account needs Security Admin on the core host project in order to assign roles to the prod project‚Äôs service account.

‚∏ª

üéØ Why does the seed service account need Security Admin on the Core host project?

1Ô∏è‚É£ Cross-project role assignment
	‚Ä¢	The prod project‚Äôs service account needs to operate on resources in the Core project (for example, to:
	‚Ä¢	authorize PSC consumers
	‚Ä¢	attach Service Directory to the Core VPC
	‚Ä¢	perhaps interact with shared networks
)
	‚Ä¢	Because those resources (VPCs, networks) belong to the Core project, their IAM lives in the Core project.
	‚Ä¢	Therefore, to grant the prod service account permission to modify or attach things on the Core project, you must bind roles in the Core project‚Äôs IAM policy for the prod service account.

‚úÖ For example:
	‚Ä¢	You need to grant the prod SA the ability to modify PSC authorized consumers referencing Core networks
	‚Ä¢	Or allow it to register Service Directory in Core‚Äôs VPC
‚Üí these are IAM permissions on Core project resources.

That means the seed service account (which is doing the Terraform) must have enough permission on the Core project to assign those IAM roles. That‚Äôs exactly what Security Admin allows:

roles/iam.securityAdmin
allows you to grant roles to any principal on any resource in that project.

‚∏ª

2Ô∏è‚É£ Least privilege
You could, in theory, use only roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin if you only manage project-level bindings, but in practice Security Admin is needed if you also want to:
	‚Ä¢	manage bindings on a subset of resources
	‚Ä¢	avoid granting even broader Owner permissions
	‚Ä¢	handle service accounts and their role assignments with fine-grained IAM

‚∏ª

3Ô∏è‚É£ Automation scope
Since you are automating the entire IAM lifecycle through the seed SA, and since the prod SA will work on PSC/Service Directory inside Core‚Äôs network, you must do those IAM grants from the Core project. Hence the seed SA needs sufficient permissions to create or update those IAM bindings in Core. Security Admin is the standard role for that.

‚∏ª

üü¢ In one-line justification you can put in a design doc:

The seed service account requires roles/iam.securityAdmin on the Core host project so it can assign IAM roles to the prod project service account, enabling that prod service account to operate on Core-hosted resources such as Private Service Connect service attachments and Service Directory namespaces attached to the Core VPC.
