JIRA Feature Title:
Subnet Reclamation Framework and Automation Roadmap

⸻

Description:

⸻

Business Driver

Our IP address pools across SDLC environments are nearing exhaustion, which is delaying or blocking onboarding of new workloads including GKE clusters, Composer, and AI Notebooks. Currently, 230+ subnets are identified as unused for over 90 days, resulting in waste of valuable IP resources.

By implementing a systematic subnet reclamation process, we can free up these unused ranges, improving our ability to provision critical workloads quickly while maintaining a sustainable, secure, and efficient network footprint.

⸻

OKR (Value Statement / Outcome)

✅ Objective: Reclaim and optimize IP ranges to ensure smooth onboarding of future projects and support the organization’s growth
✅ Key Result: Successfully reclaim a minimum of 15 subnets per week, achieving at least 90% utilization of freed IP ranges within the next 3 sprints
✅ Outcome:
	•	Reduced IP shortages and provisioning delays
	•	More efficient and secure network architecture
	•	Faster time-to-market for application teams requesting new services
