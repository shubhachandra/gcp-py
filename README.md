Subject: Updates on Network JSON Files and Firewall Logging

Hi Team,

Please find the updates and next steps regarding the network configuration files and firewall logging below:
	•	network-py2y.json:
This file is currently enabling logging for DNS managed zones. Ruth Icon was working on this, but the recent apply failed, so the changes had to be reverted. I will coordinate with him further to fix and reapply the changes.
	•	networking-1fd7:
Most firewall rules here were created by GKE, and logging is disabled by default. We should add Terraform code to enable firewall logging during rule creation, so that logging is enabled by default. This task should be transitioned to the Landing Zone team, as they own the default logging configurations.
	•	network-c510.json:
We can proceed to enable logging for all subnets defined in the main.tf of each SDLC environment.

Please let me know if you have any questions or would like me to set up a follow-up discussion.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
