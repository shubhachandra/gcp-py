Risk Overlay Section (Insert This)

As part of my responsibilities, I actively identified and mitigated risks that could impact delivery and operations:
	‚Ä¢	IAM Policy Binding Limits: Identified policy binding errors at the subnet and later at the host project level. I escalated this early, collected concrete evidence of the failure patterns, and collaborated with the Google team to increase the quota from 1500 to 2500, preventing outages in future releases.
	‚Ä¢	Version Risk Escalation: During v4.1.0, I raised a concern that the fix addressed subnet-level issues but not host-level bindings. This was later confirmed and resolved in coordination with Google in v4.2.0. I provided clear documentation and ensured the larger impact was communicated and understood by the broader team.
	‚Ä¢	Reclamation & Resource Efficiency: Through subnet cleanup and integration with Network Intelligence Center tools, I minimized risk of IP exhaustion and improved visibility on unused subnets.
	‚Ä¢	Tooling & Automation Risk: Initiated and led automation efforts (Excel/VBA-based iPAM) to reduce manual errors and allocation conflicts ‚Äî significantly reducing operational risks in UP allocation.

Overall, I have taken ownership in identifying, mitigating, and communicating risks across both technical and coordination fronts, ensuring delivery remained stable, scalable, and forward-lookingHere‚Äôs a well-structured, professional self-evaluation draft based on your detailed input.

‚úÖ Successes & Achievements

Over the past cycle, I have made significant contributions across multiple areas of the network engineering and IP management landscape. Key achievements include:
	‚Ä¢	Deep Networking Expertise: Gained comprehensive understanding of the networking team‚Äôs scope‚Äîboth in breadth and depth. This allowed me to operate effectively across subnet design, policy binding limits, and regional expansions.
	‚Ä¢	IP Address Demarcation & UP Allocation: Played a pivotal role in the UP address demarcation initiative. Along with a teammate, co-built a self-sufficient solution for UP allocation, later handed over to the Ops team for operational use.
	‚Ä¢	Policy Binding Limit Coordination: Led the effort to resolve a critical blocker by coordinating with the Google Cloud team and successfully increasing the IAM policy binding limit from 1500 to 2500, mitigating a major deployment risk.
	‚Ä¢	Tactical Fixes & Escalations: Contributed to two tactical fixes, provided detailed resolution steps, and proactively escalated the larger implications‚Äîensuring the issue was addressed strategically, not just reactively.
	‚Ä¢	Cross-Team Collaboration:
	‚Ä¢	Worked closely with the Landing Zone and IAM teams to troubleshoot and resolve key networking and identity issues.
	‚Ä¢	Actively collaborated with the Grafana team to enable real-time visualization for network observability.
	‚Ä¢	iPAM Automation: Initiated the IP Address Management (iPAM) discussion and drove the design of an automated solution using Excel and VBA, laying the foundation for future scalability.
	‚Ä¢	Regional Expansion Support: Enabled the build-out of two new regions‚Äîus-south1 and us-east4‚Äîthrough structured collaboration and planning, ensuring network readiness and IP allocations were in place.
	‚Ä¢	Subnet Reclamation and Intelligence:
	‚Ä¢	Engaged with the Network Intelligence Center tools to identify and reclaim unused subnets, improving IP hygiene.
	‚Ä¢	Led cleanup efforts for Private Service Connect (PSC) and other unused subnets.
	‚Ä¢	Issue Identification & Risk Mitigation:
	‚Ä¢	During the release of version 4.1.0, identified a subnet-level IAM binding issue that was later observed at the host project level.
	‚Ä¢	Documented, escalated, and coordinated a fix in version 4.2.0 and engaged Google support for resolution.
	‚Ä¢	Provided technical evidence, clearly articulated root causes, and helped drive a long-term resolution.

üöÄ Focus Areas
	‚Ä¢	IP demarcation and allocation
	‚Ä¢	Homegrown iPAM tooling and automation
	‚Ä¢	Subnet creation, cleanup, and reuse
	‚Ä¢	Cross-team coordination (IAM, Landing Zone, Grafana)
	‚Ä¢	Observability and dashboard improvements
	‚Ä¢	Strategic engagement with Google Cloud for policy limit enhancements

üß© Challenges & Risk Mitigation

One notable risk during v4.1.0 release involved subnet-level IAM binding limits. Though fixed in 4.1.0, similar issues reoccurred at the host project level in 4.2.0. I successfully documented the risk, brought clarity to its scale, and ensured our team coordinated directly with Google Cloud to achieve a sustainable solution through a quota increase.

üìå Summary

Overall, my contributions span the entire IP lifecycle: from subnet creation, address demarcation, reclamation, and automation to observability, region expansion, and quota management. I have been proactive in identifying blockers, proposing solutions, and collaborating across teams to drive delivery. I look forward to maturing our internal tools, deepening automation, and continuing to enhance resilience and scalability in the networking space.
