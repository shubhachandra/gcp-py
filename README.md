In Google Cloud Platform (GCP), the logs and metrics you mentioned are used for observability, performance monitoring, troubleshooting, and security auditing. Here’s a breakdown of each and whether it is required (important for most production workloads) or optional (useful depending on your architecture and use case):

⸻

🔐 Firewall Logs

Metric	Use	Required/Optional
Firewall Rule Timestamp	Indicates when a firewall rule was triggered. Useful for auditing and debugging network access.	✅ Required for security & audit trails.
Firewall Rule Hit Count	Shows how often a rule is matched. Helps tune rules or detect anomalies.	⚠️ Optional, but very useful for security visibility.


⸻

🌐 Interconnect Metrics

Metric	Use	Required/Optional
Interconnect Attachment Ingress Traffic	Measures data entering GCP through Dedicated/Partner Interconnect.	✅ Required if using Interconnect; critical for bandwidth and billing monitoring.
Interconnect Attachment Egress Traffic	Measures data leaving GCP via Interconnect.	✅ Required for network planning and cost monitoring.
Interconnect Ingress Traffic by Attachment	Granular insight into per-attachment traffic. Useful for multi-site or hybrid cloud.	⚠️ Optional, but helpful for large deployments.


⸻

🧠 Cloud DNS Metrics

Metric	Use	Required/Optional
DNS Rate of Response Count	Tracks how many responses are being returned, useful for traffic visibility.	⚠️ Optional, unless you’re using custom DNS for high volumes.
DNS Latencies	Helps measure DNS resolution times, important for performance tuning.	⚠️ Optional, but useful in performance-sensitive apps.


⸻

🖥️ VM Metrics

Metric	Use	Required/Optional
VM to VM RTT (Round Trip Time) Latency by Zone	Measures latency between VMs in different zones. Useful for troubleshooting latency-sensitive workloads.	⚠️ Optional, unless running latency-sensitive microservices.


⸻

📊 Custom Application Metrics

Metric	Use	Required/Optional
Average Prod Count (Success & Failure)	Tracks custom business logic outcomes (e.g., successful API calls, job failures).	✅ Required, if monitoring app-level reliability.


⸻

🌐 Load Balancer Metrics

Metric	Use	Required/Optional
Average Backend Services Request Rate	Measures load balancer traffic distribution to backends.	✅ Required for performance and auto-scaling.
Backend Service Request Count	Total requests sent to each backend. Helps in capacity planning and performance monitoring.	✅ Required for backend health and scaling.

✅ Recommended Required Metrics

These are commonly needed in any production-grade deployment:
	•	Firewall Rule Timestamp
	•	Interconnect Traffic (if used)
	•	Application Success/Failure Count
	•	Load Balancer Request Metrics

Let me know your exact use case (e.g., hybrid cloud, e-commerce, internal apps), and I can further tailor what’s critical vs. optional for you.

Great follow-up, Shubh! Let’s identify what useful and potentially missing metrics/logs you might want to include for comprehensive observability in GCP, depending on your architecture (like VPC, hybrid, GKE, GCE, Load Balancing, etc.).

🔍 What’s Missing and Useful

Below are some important metrics/logs that are often overlooked but are very helpful in production environments:

⸻

🧩 1. VPC Flow Logs
	•	Use: Provides detailed network traffic logs at the VM level (source/destination IPs, ports, bytes sent, etc.).
	•	Why it’s useful: Crucial for detecting lateral movement, analyzing traffic patterns, and troubleshooting connectivity issues.
	•	✅ Recommended if you want full network visibility.

⸻

🧩 2. GCE Instance Metrics (Compute Engine)
	•	CPU Utilization
	•	Disk I/O and throughput
	•	Network I/O (ingress/egress)
	•	Why it’s useful: Helps detect performance bottlenecks or capacity issues at the VM level.
	•	✅ Must-have for VM-based workloads.

⸻

🧩 3. GKE (Kubernetes) Metrics & Logs
	•	Pod CPU/memory usage
	•	Container restarts
	•	Kubernetes events
	•	Node health
	•	Why it’s useful: Required for monitoring containerized workloads.
	•	✅ Required for GKE users.

⸻

🧩 4. Load Balancer Health Check Logs
	•	Use: Shows which backend is failing and why.
	•	Why it’s useful: Critical for diagnosing traffic routing issues.
	•	✅ Required if using GCP Load Balancers.

⸻

🧩 5. Google Cloud Audit Logs
	•	Admin Activity
	•	Data Access
	•	System Events
	•	Why it’s useful: Tracks who did what in your environment — useful for security, compliance, and forensic analysis.
	•	✅ Required for enterprise and regulated environments.

⸻

🧩 6. Google Cloud Error Reporting
	•	Automatically aggregates application errors and exceptions.
	•	Why it’s useful: Great for application observability without adding custom logic.
	•	✅ Highly recommended for app developers.

⸻

🧩 7. Cloud NAT Metrics
	•	Connections by VM
	•	Port exhaustion
	•	Throughput
	•	Why it’s useful: Helps understand network egress patterns and prevent NAT failures.
	•	⚠️ Useful if you’re using Cloud NAT with no external IPs.

⸻

🧩 8. Google Cloud Billing Metrics
	•	Cost per service/project
	•	Forecasted spend
	•	Why it’s useful: Tracks and alerts on unexpected spend.
	•	✅ Required in cost-sensitive environments.

⸻

🧩 9. IAM Policy Changes
	•	Changes in roles, members, or bindings.
	•	Why it’s useful: Detect privilege escalations or unauthorized access.
	•	✅ Required for security auditing.

⸻

🧩 10. Persistent Disk Metrics
	•	IOPS
	•	Throughput
	•	Queue depth
	•	Why it’s useful: Helps with storage performance diagnostics.
	•	⚠️ Useful in high-performance storage use cases.

⸻

🧠 Final Tip: Use Cloud Monitoring Dashboards and Log-Based Metrics
	•	Create custom dashboards for:
	•	App success/failure
	•	Load balancer latency
	•	DNS lookup failures
	•	Backend error rates
	•	Create alerts using log-based metrics (e.g., firewall deny, DNS errors, 5xx errors)
