We’ve hit rock bottom on this issue and need your urgent attention.

The Project Factory code provided by Google cannot be modified any further, as a majority of our environments—both non-production and production—have become dependent on it. This limitation has placed us in a rigid position where making any updates or enhancements is no longer feasible without risking environment stability.

Additionally, we are facing the 1500-member limit on IAM policy bindings, which is now a critical blocker for us. These two constraints combined are preventing us from moving forward.

We are requesting an urgent exception and/or feature support to unblock this situation. This is the highest level of escalation from our team, and we need your immediate intervention to prevent further delays and disruptions.
