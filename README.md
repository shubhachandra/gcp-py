Subject: [FYI] Subnet Reclamation Notification for FNDD Application – Action Required Within 5 Business Days

⸻

Hi FNDD Application Team,

As part of our subnet reclamation initiative, we have identified two subnets under your project that have been unused for more than 90 days and appear to have no active resources attached. Please review the details below:

⸻

Subnet Details:

1️⃣ Subnet Name: subnet1
	•	IP Range: 100.123.78.0/24
	•	SDLC Environment: sandbox
	•	App ID: fndd
	•	Service Project Name: fndd-nonprod-786
	•	Days Since Last Update: 103 days
	•	Planned Deletion Date: 5 business days from today

2️⃣ Subnet Name: subnet2
	•	IP Range: 100.123.76.0/24
	•	SDLC Environment: nonprod
	•	App ID: fndd
	•	Service Project Name: fndd-nonprod-786
	•	Days Since Last Update: 103 days
	•	Planned Deletion Date: 5 business days from today

⸻

Important Notes:
	•	These subnets will be deleted after 5 business days from today unless you provide a valid justification for retaining them.
	•	If you believe these subnets are still required, please reply with your justification within this period.
	•	In the absence of a response, and no active resources detected, we will proceed with deletion as planned.

Your prompt cooperation is appreciated to ensure efficient use of our IP address resources.

If you have any questions or concerns, please let us know.

Thank you,

Subject: [Important] New Process for Unused Subnet Reclamation – Starting This Sprint

⸻

Hi All,

As part of our network optimization and sustainability efforts, we are implementing a subnet reclamation process starting this sprint. This initiative is critical because IP address ranges are a limited resource, and we are currently experiencing shortages that affect our ability to provision new services and meet ongoing demands.

⸻

What will happen?
	•	From this sprint onward, the Networking and Ops teams will review subnets that have not been used for more than 90 days.
	•	You will receive a separate communication if any such subnets are identified under your projects.
	•	These notifications will include:
	•	Subnet name
	•	Associated SDLC environment
	•	Service project name
	•	Planned deletion timeline

⸻

What you need to do:

✅ Review the subnet details provided in those emails.
✅ If you still need any of these subnets, please respond within 5 business days with a valid justification for retaining them.
✅ If no response is received within that time frame, and no active resources are detected, we will assume the subnet is safe to delete and proceed with reclamation.

⸻

Why are we doing this?
	•	The pool of available IP address ranges is limited and close to exhaustion.
	•	By reclaiming unused subnets, we can free up IP capacity to fulfill current and future project needs, including critical deployments for GKE clusters, Composer, and AI Notebooks.
	•	This process will help maintain a clean, efficient, and sustainable network environment.

⸻

We appreciate your support and cooperation to ensure this initiative is successful. Please reach out if you have any questions or would like to discuss this further.

Thank you for working with us to keep our infrastructure healthy and future-ready.

Best regards,
