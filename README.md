Hi Team,

Thank you all for joining the discussion today. Here's a quick summary of the meeting outcomes and next steps regarding the **Subnet Reclamation Process**.

### âœ… Key Outcomes

1. **Process Approval:**
   The subnet reclamation process has been **officially approved**. We appreciate everyone's input and collaboration in shaping this framework.

2. **Initial Scope Agreement:**
   We will begin the process by targeting **lower environments** â€“ specifically, **nonprod** and **sandbox** subnets.

3. **PR Strategy:**
   We will raise PRs by grouping **subnets based on SDLC and App ID** for clarity and ease of tracking.

4. **Intake Request Details:**
   Intake requests will include:

   * Subnet Name
   * IP Range
   * App ID
     This structured detail will help the Ops team efficiently process CRs.

5. **Sign-off Requirement:**
   It was agreed that **app team sign-off is mandatory** before reclaiming any subnet.
   We will not proceed based on FYI emails alone.
   âž¤ **Shwetha** will own the coordination and ensure sign-off collection from application owners.

6. **Progress Made:**

   * PR raised successfully for the **networking repo**
   * We are now capable of raising PRs for **delinking subnets** from the **project provisioning repo**

7. **Automation Initiatives:**

   * **Hema** will share her code with **Greyorg** to help automate the **intake request** creation process.
   * We plan to **automate CR creation** as a next step in the roadmap.
