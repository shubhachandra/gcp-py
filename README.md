Perfect üëç Here‚Äôs your self-assessment written clearly with each major work item broken into the required three-part format (Situation ‚Üí My Contribution ‚Üí What We Achieved):

‚∏ª

1. IAM Policy Binding Quota Issue

Situation:
In March 2025, project creation and application onboarding were blocked due to hitting the IAM policy member binding quota limits in multiple projects.

My Contribution:
I investigated the root cause, explained the quota limitation and its business impact, and proposed both tactical (cleanup of unused bindings) and strategic (migration to group-based IAM bindings) solutions. I also worked closely with application teams to help them understand and implement the required IAM changes.

What We Achieved:
The issue was permanently resolved by implementing group-based IAM bindings, ensuring scalability and eliminating recurring project creation failures. This improved governance and reduced future operational overhead.

2. IP Address Management and Reclamation Process

Situation:
The organization lacked an automated IPAM solution, and IP allocations were being manually tracked through SharePoint, leading to inefficiencies and inconsistent utilization.

My Contribution:
I took ownership of maintaining and updating the manual IP allocation sheet, introduced clear demarcation of IP ranges, and established a process for revoking unused IPs. I collaborated with Cloud Ops and application teams to implement an approval and communication workflow for reclamation.

What We Achieved:
Created a repeatable, auditable IP address management process, improving visibility and freeing up significant unused IP ranges. This initiative laid the foundation for future IPAM automation.

‚∏ª

3. Composer Migration (Composer 2 ‚Üí Composer 3)

Situation:
The Composer team planned to migrate over 300 environments to Composer 3, initially requesting one dedicated subnet per Composer instance, which risked IP range exhaustion.

My Contribution:
I proposed using a shared subnet model combined with HNAT, explained the design benefits, and helped the team implement and validate the setup.

What We Achieved:
Optimized IP utilization, avoided subnet exhaustion, and provided a scalable model that supported all Composer environments efficiently.

4. Private Service Connect (PSC) and Vertex AI Networking

Situation:
Teams faced issues setting up PSC for the network prediction service integrated with Vertex AI, including a critical issue where PSC consumer subnets were wrongly flagged due to Terraform apply behavior.

My Contribution:
I analyzed and identified the Terraform-related issue, provided technical guidance to correct the configuration, and shared learnings with the broader team through a brown-bag session.

What We Achieved:
Resolved the PSC configuration issue, improved reliability of PSC deployments, and enhanced team knowledge to prevent similar future incidents.

5. Knowledge Sharing and Documentation

Situation:
There was limited team awareness around network segmentation concepts and the current network design architecture.

My Contribution:
I conducted brown-bag sessions on PSC troubleshooting, micro and macro segmentation, and created detailed network architecture diagrams. I also contributed to the Prod Discovery setup for the AD-ENT environment.

What We Achieved:
Improved team understanding of network architecture and security segmentation. Enhanced documentation and onboarding resources for ongoing and future projects.
