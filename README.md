Subject: Task Rescheduled Due to Prod Change Restrictions

Hi [Recipient’s Name],

This task cannot be completed today and has been moved to tomorrow. As per the EMEA/APAC cautionary period guidelines, no production changes should be scheduled before 9 AM EST on Mondays.

It appears the original schedule was set before 9 AM, which will lead to the change being rejected. Hence, the team will need to reschedule it for tomorrow.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

Let me know if you want it to be more formal or addressed to a specific team.
