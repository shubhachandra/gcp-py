Subject: Request for Proactive Quota Alerts for Networking Resources

Hi Louis,

I hope you’re doing well.

I’d like to request quota monitoring and proactive alerts for networking-related quotas in our GCP projects. Specifically, we should be alerted when usage reaches 90% of the quota limit or is about to exceed it. These alerts need to be actionable as part of our observability framework, so that the team can take preventive steps before service impact.

Could you confirm if such quota alerting is already part of the broader quota observability plan, or if we need to define networking-specific quotas separately?

This request is based on the quota issue we faced last week, where we had to reach out to Google support for a quota increase after the impact. To avoid similar incidents for both production and non-production environments, it’s important that we have proactive alerts in place.

Please let me know the next steps on whether this can be included in the existing observability setup, or if we need to raise a separate request to have it implemented.

Thanks,
Shubh

Would you like me to also list the key networking quotas (e.g., Networks, Subnetworks, VPN tunnels, Interconnects, Static IPs, Routes) in the mail so Louis knows exactly which ones to cover, or keep it high-level?

🔎 What to Monitor in GCP Networking

1. VPC & Subnets
	•	Resource inventory: number of VPCs, subnets, IP utilization.
	•	Subnet utilization: used vs. available IPs.
	•	Flow logs:
	•	Top talkers (src/dst IPs, bytes, packets).
	•	Denied connections.
	•	Latency & retransmissions.
	•	Routing changes: unexpected changes in routes, blackhole routes.

⸻

2. Firewalls
	•	Firewall rule usage (hit count from firewall logs).
	•	Denied vs allowed traffic (esp. denied hits from unexpected sources).
	•	Shadowed / redundant rules detection.
	•	High volume drops → possible attack or misconfig.

⸻

3. Private Service Connect (PSC)
	•	PSC Endpoints:
	•	Endpoint connection status (healthy/unhealthy).
	•	Connection latency, throughput.
	•	Unauthorized or rejected connections.
	•	PSC Backends:
	•	Health of backend services.
	•	Load distribution.
	•	Connection failures.

⸻

4. Cloud NAT
	•	Active connections per NAT gateway.
	•	SNAT port utilization (exhaustion risk).
	•	Translation errors/drops.
	•	Throughput & latency.

⸻

5. Network Connectivity Center (NCC) & NCC NAT
	•	NCC hub/spoke health.
	•	On-prem → cloud tunnel status (BGP session up/down, latency).
	•	NCC NAT metrics (similar to Cloud NAT).
	•	Route advertisements (unexpected route leaks).

⸻

6. Cloud DNS
	•	Query volume (QPS).
	•	Top queried domains.
	•	NXDOMAIN/ServFail rates.
	•	Latency in DNS resolution.
	•	Unauthorized zones or spoofing attempts.

⸻

7. Interconnect
	•	Link utilization (in/out traffic).
	•	BGP session status.
	•	CRC/FCS errors on link.
	•	Packet drops or high latency.
	•	Failover events (link down, switch to backup).

⸻

8. Service Directory
	•	Service registration changes.
	•	Unhealthy endpoints.
	•	Orphaned services (no backends).

⸻

9. Load Balancers (External & Internal)
	•	Request count / latency / throughput.
	•	Backend health checks (pass/fail).
	•	5xx error rates.
	•	SSL/TLS certificate expiry.
	•	Connection drops or resets.
	•	Geo-distribution of traffic (sudden shift might indicate attack).

⸻

📊 Suggested Dashboards

Organize dashboards by layers:
	1.	Traffic Flow & Connectivity
	•	Top talkers, flows, allowed vs denied traffic.
	•	Latency, packet drops.
	•	Interconnect/NCC link status.
	2.	Resource Utilization
	•	Subnet IP usage.
	•	NAT SNAT port utilization.
	•	Interconnect bandwidth.
	3.	Security Posture
	•	Denied firewall hits.
	•	Unexpected PSC or LB connections.
	•	DNS anomalies (high NXDOMAIN, spoofing).
	4.	Service Health
	•	LB backend health.
	•	PSC backend availability.
	•	DNS resolution success.
	5.	Change & Drift Monitoring
	•	New VPCs, subnets, firewall rules.
	•	BGP route changes.
	•	Service Directory updates.

⸻

⚠️ Key Anomalies to Watch
	•	VPC/Subnets: sudden IP exhaustion, unusual east-west traffic, unexpected route ads.
	•	Firewalls: spike in denied traffic, unused rules (possible misconfig).
	•	PSC: endpoint disconnects, backend flaps.
	•	NAT (Cloud/NCC): port exhaustion, translation errors, connection drops.
	•	NCC/Interconnect: BGP flaps, link congestion >80%, packet loss >1%.
	•	DNS: spikes in NXDOMAIN (typo-squatting, malware C2), latency >100ms.
	•	Load Balancers: backend failure spikes, 5xx > 1%, traffic imbalance.
	•	Certificates: expiring LB certs not rotated.
	•	Security: DDoS patterns, data exfiltration (large outbound flows to unusual IPs).

👉 This setup would give you end-to-end observability for GCP networking: infra health, traffic visibility, utilization, and security posture.

Do you want me to also map this to specific GCP Monitoring metrics/logs (e.g., metric names like loadbalancing.googleapis.com/..., dns.googleapis.com/...) so you can plug directly into Cloud Monitoring dashboards/alerts?
