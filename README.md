Here’s a combined and polished version of both updates in one email:

Subject: Subnet Quota & Environment Status Update

The total number of subnets, including both primary and secondary, is shown in the following table.
The quota set in each host VPC is 275. Based on current usage, this quota counts only primary subnets, not secondary ranges. This is a soft quota and can typically be increased — up to 15,000 subnet IP ranges — if required.

Our sandbox environment is ready, but the nonprod environment is not yet available.
If the issue with /29 subnets persists, the /17 range will become available once the change request is approved.

Testing in the sandbox environment has been completed successfully. If required, we can direct the 1IBD app team to use the broader /17 subnet.

Do you want me to also add a small diagram showing /29 as part of /17 so the recipients can visually understand the relationship? That often helps with subnet discussions.
