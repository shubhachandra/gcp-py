Here’s a clearer and more grammatically correct version of your sentence:

“These tickets will have to wait for at least two more sprints. The Landing Zone team will coordinate with the Sentinel team, ServiceNow team, Monitoring and Logging team. They will also ensure that the correct environment validation and required labeling are set through the CI environment variable.”

Alternate version (if you prefer it in a single sentence):

“These tickets will have to wait for at least two more sprints, while the Landing Zone team coordinates with the Sentinel, ServiceNow, and Monitoring and Logging teams to set the correct environment validation and required labeling via the CI environment variable.”

Let me know if you’d like a more formal or more concise version.

Let me know your exact use case (e.g., hybrid cloud, e-commerce, internal apps), and I can further tailor what’s critical vs. optional for you.

Great follow-up, Shubh! Let’s identify what useful and potentially missing metrics/logs you might want to include for comprehensive observability in GCP, depending on your architecture (like VPC, hybrid, GKE, GCE, Load Balancing, etc.).

⸻

🔍 What’s Missing and Useful

Below are some important metrics/logs that are often overlooked but are very helpful in production environments:

⸻

🧩 1. VPC Flow Logs
	•	Use: Provides detailed network traffic logs at the VM level (source/destination IPs, ports, bytes sent, etc.).
	•	Why it’s useful: Crucial for detecting lateral movement, analyzing traffic patterns, and troubleshooting connectivity issues.
	•	✅ Recommended if you want full network visibility.

⸻

🧩 2. GCE Instance Metrics (Compute Engine)
	•	CPU Utilization
	•	Disk I/O and throughput
	•	Network I/O (ingress/egress)
	•	Why it’s useful: Helps detect performance bottlenecks or capacity issues at the VM level.
	•	✅ Must-have for VM-based workloads.

⸻

🧩 3. GKE (Kubernetes) Metrics & Logs
	•	Pod CPU/memory usage
	•	Container restarts
	•	Kubernetes events
	•	Node health
	•	Why it’s useful: Required for monitoring containerized workloads.
	•	✅ Required for GKE users.

⸻

🧩 4. Load Balancer Health Check Logs
	•	Use: Shows which backend is failing and why.
	•	Why it’s useful: Critical for diagnosing traffic routing issues.
	•	✅ Required if using GCP Load Balancers.

⸻

🧩 5. Google Cloud Audit Logs
	•	Admin Activity
	•	Data Access
	•	System Events
	•	Why it’s useful: Tracks who did what in your environment — useful for security, compliance, and forensic analysis.
	•	✅ Required for enterprise and regulated environments.

⸻

🧩 6. Google Cloud Error Reporting
	•	Automatically aggregates application errors and exceptions.
	•	Why it’s useful: Great for application observability without adding custom logic.
	•	✅ Highly recommended for app developers.

⸻

🧩 7. Cloud NAT Metrics
	•	Connections by VM
	•	Port exhaustion
	•	Throughput
	•	Why it’s useful: Helps understand network egress patterns and prevent NAT failures.
	•	⚠️ Useful if you’re using Cloud NAT with no external IPs.

⸻

🧩 8. Google Cloud Billing Metrics
	•	Cost per service/project
	•	Forecasted spend
	•	Why it’s useful: Tracks and alerts on unexpected spend.
	•	✅ Required in cost-sensitive environments.

⸻

🧩 9. IAM Policy Changes
	•	Changes in roles, members, or bindings.
	•	Why it’s useful: Detect privilege escalations or unauthorized access.
	•	✅ Required for security auditing.

⸻

🧩 10. Persistent Disk Metrics
	•	IOPS
	•	Throughput
	•	Queue depth
	•	Why it’s useful: Helps with storage performance diagnostics.
	•	⚠️ Useful in high-performance storage use cases.

⸻

🧠 Final Tip: Use Cloud Monitoring Dashboards and Log-Based Metrics
	•	Create custom dashboards for:
	•	App success/failure
	•	Load balancer latency
	•	DNS lookup failures
	•	Backend error rates
	•	Create alerts using log-based metrics (e.g., firewall deny, DNS errors, 5xx errors)
