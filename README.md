Great point. To address the Ops team’s overhead and build a business justification for requesting a dedicated Subnet Reclaim Team or function, here’s a proposal you can use with leadership or program management.

🔧 Proposal: Dedicated Subnet Reclaim Support Team

📌 Current Challenge
	•	Subnet reclaim requires multi-team coordination, including:
	•	Analysis (Network team)
	•	Outreach (currently done by Ops)
	•	Intake request creation
	•	Terraform PR and apply
	•	Ops team is already resource-constrained, and this adds significant overhead:
	•	Time spent identifying owners
	•	Chasing app teams for confirmation
	•	Managing ticket lifecycle

⸻

🧩 Request: Form a Dedicated Subnet Reclaim Coordination Team

🛠 Proposed Roles of the Dedicated Team
	•	Act as a liaison between network, app, and ops teams.
	•	Handle all communication with application owners.
	•	Create and track intake requests.
	•	Maintain the subnet reclaim tracker/dashboard.
	•	Coordinate Terraform PR workflow in collaboration with Infra-as-Code team.

📈 Business Justification / Advantages

Area	Benefit
IP Space Optimization	Frees up unused subnets, preventing IP exhaustion in long-running projects (e.g., for GKE/Composer).
Network Hygiene	Reduces clutter of orphaned subnets, improving routing and firewall clarity.
Faster Provisioning	Minimizes wait time for new subnet allocation, avoiding unnecessary /18 or /16 expansions.
Ops Efficiency	Removes non-core workload from Ops, letting them focus on provisioning and incident handling.
Audit Readiness	Maintains clean inventory with ownership validation and deletion records.
Automation Readiness	Helps build patterns that could later be partially or fully automated.

📆 Suggested Timeline and SLAs

Stage	Duration
Report reviewed by network team	Day 1–2
Shortlist sent to reclaim team	Day 3
App team contacted	Day 4
App team response window	Day 4–9 (5 business days)
Intake request raised	Day 10
Terraform PR created and merged	Day 11–13
Apply changes	Day 14
Final confirmation and update	Day 15

⏱️ Total Timeline per reclaim cycle: ~15 calendar days (~2 weeks)

⸻

🧮 Resource Estimation for Dedicated Team

Assuming ~50 reclaimable subnets per month:
	•	1 FTE (full-time equivalent) can manage:
	•	Communication & tracking
	•	2–3 subnet reclaims per day
	•	Status updates and intake processing
	•	Can be part of a Network Ops or Infra Governance team.

⸻

📝 Suggested Action Items
	1.	Present to Infra/Cloud leadership.
	2.	Define a pilot phase (e.g., reclaim effort across 2 SDLCs).
	3.	Track reclaimed IPs vs. effort hours for ROI tracking.
	4.	Formalize the reclaim cycle into a monthly hygiene task.
