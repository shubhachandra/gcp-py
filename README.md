Subject: Introduction of Subnet Reclamation Process â€“ Ops Team Support & Clarification

â¸»

Hi Ops Team,

As part of our ongoing network hygiene and IP address optimization efforts, we are introducing a subnet reclamation process starting this sprint. This initiative will help us recover unused IP ranges to fulfill current and future provisioning demands, as our IP pool is nearing exhaustion.

â¸»

Process Overview

âœ… Networking Team responsibilities
	â€¢	Analyze subnet usage reports
	â€¢	Identify subnets unused for more than 90 days
	â€¢	Communicate directly with the application teams for validation
	â€¢	Raise intake requests with confirmed subnet details

âœ… Ops Team responsibilities
	â€¢	Create and manage the Change Requests (CRs) to remove these subnets from Terraform once the intake request is submitted
	â€¢	There is no need for the Ops team to reach out to application teams, as the Networking team will coordinate directly

Discussion Points for Your Input

ðŸ‘‰ 1. Intake Request Strategy
Would you prefer to handle subnet deletions through:
	â€¢	one consolidated intake request per SDLC environment, or
	â€¢	separate intake requests for each subnet?

ðŸ‘‰ 2. Dedicated Reclamation Day
Can we dedicate one day of the week (e.g., every Wednesday) to process subnet reclamation activities?

ðŸ‘‰ 3. Lead Time Adjustments
Given the 7-day CR approval for production, could this be optimized if we dedicate a specific day to these activities?

ðŸ‘‰ 4. Batch Strategy
We have identified approximately 230 unused subnets.
	â€¢	Should we process these in batches of 50 per week/sprint, or
	â€¢	would you prefer we reclaim them all in a single batch?

ðŸ‘‰ 5. Future Automation
We plan to automate the full lifecycle in the future â€” from subnet identification to PR creation, intake request, CR, approval, and apply. Weâ€™d like to keep you in the loop on those plans as well.

Next Steps

âœ… We would like to schedule a meeting to discuss this further and finalize the approach.

Before scheduling, we request you kindly share your inputs, questions, or concerns in advance so we can address them and make the meeting as productive as possible.

Once we hear back, we can coordinate a time that works for everyone. Please let us know if you are good to proceed with scheduling.

Thanks for your cooperation and support!
