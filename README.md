| 6  | Reclaim Logic                       | Reverse logic of reservation, free up subnet and its dependencies  | Backend    | â¬œ Not Started  | 8 Aug 2025  | Must sync with status table  |
| 7  | Dashboard UI                        | Show available/used IPs by CIDR size, filter by region/SDLC/status | Frontend   | â¬œ Not Started  | 9 Aug 2025  | Group by size                |
| 8  | Reporting API                       | API for dashboard data aggregation                                 | Backend    | â¬œ Not Started  | 9 Aug 2025  | Query with aggregation       |
| 9  | List + Hold as Planned (UI + Logic) | List IPs with filters, allow marking as â€˜plannedâ€™                  | Fullstack  | â¬œ Not Started  | 10 Aug 2025 | status = planned             |
| 10 | Supernet/Subnet Availability Logic  | Custom logic to detect parent/child subnets and adjust status      | Backend    | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress | 5 Aug 2025  | Core component               |
| 11 | Testing Framework                   | Unit test for all subnet functions (reserve, reclaim, create)      | QA/Backend | â¬œ Not Started  | 12 Aug 2025 | Use pytest or Postman tests  |
| 12 | Audit Trail Table                   | Optional: Track who made changes and when                          | DevOps     | â¬œ Optional     | TBD         | Stretch goal                 |

## ðŸ”§ Next Steps

### Optional Features to Consider:

* **Excel/VBA version of UI** for offline reservation tracking
* **Role-based access** (e.g., only admins can reclaim)
* **Notification system** for planned reservations expiring soon
* **IP utilization heatmap** (future visual feature)

---

Let me know if you'd like:

* A **Kanban board (Notion / Trello template)** for this tracker
* Exportable **CSV of tasks**
* Sample data for test ranges (e.g., generate test `/24` to `/29` entries)

Would you like to begin implementing with Excel/VBA first or jump to a web-based backend (Flask/Django/etc.)?
