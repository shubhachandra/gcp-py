Notebook creation process involves 3 steps:
	1.	Create the Notebook Service Account
	2.	Assign the required IAM roles to the Service Account
	3.	Create the Notebook Instance

In Step 2, we need to remove the roles/notebooks.viewer IAM role, which is currently being assigned unnecessarily.

The Notebook Instance module (Step 3) depends on the Service Account module (Step 1). The Service Account created in Step 1 is passed as an input argument to Step 3.
