Here’s a concise and professional justification you can use for deleting the two subnets:

Justification for Subnet Deletion

The two subnets in question were previously used by the Private Service Connect (PSC) module for publishing or consuming services. After a recent architecture review and service audit, it was confirmed that:
	1.	No active PSC endpoints or service attachments are currently associated with these subnets.
	2.	The subnets are not referenced by any active firewall rules, routes, or load balancers.
	3.	There is no current or planned workload that requires these subnets.

Retaining unused subnets can lead to:
	•	Unnecessary IP range reservation, potentially limiting future subnet planning.
	•	Configuration clutter, increasing complexity and risk during troubleshooting or audits.

Therefore, to ensure optimal resource hygiene and maintain a clean networking configuration, we recommend proceeding with the deletion of these subnets.
