### **Jira Title:**

Create 3 Git Repositories and Workspaces for Firewall Infrastructure Projects in AD-ENT

---

### **Description:**

We are requesting the creation of three new Git repositories and their corresponding Terraform Cloud workspaces under the AD-ENT organization. These repositories are intended to streamline and modularize our firewall-related deployments and infrastructure management.

The following repositories and associated workspaces will be created:

* **firewall-vm-deployment** – Focused on the deployment of VM-based firewall appliances (currently Palo Alto).
* **firewall-infra-resources** – Contains general infrastructure components and shared resources required for firewall setups.
* **firewall-security-appliance** (Workspace named `firewall-security-management`) – Contains policy modules, security rule automation, and vendor-agnostic appliance configuration logic.

These repositories aim to maintain a vendor-neutral design but currently support Palo Alto deployments. The goal is to improve structure, CI/CD integration, and ownership of firewall infrastructure components.

No code will be deployed immediately. Repositories will be initialized with standard files (`README.md`, `.gitignore`, backend configurations). No known issues or defects are present in this change. Monitoring and alerting changes will be planned in the later stages of pipeline setup.

There is no blast radius since the change does not affect any live environments. Validation includes confirming repository creation, correct access permissions, and workspace readiness with basic Terraform test runs.

In the event of any issue, the repositories and workspaces can be deleted or archived. Communication will be shared with DevOps, Security, and Networking teams once setup is completed.
