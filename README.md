Update on RFC1918 Address Space and Cloud NAT Implementation
	•	The plan was to use RFC1918 address space, as these IPs are non-routable by design, aligning with our goal of keeping internal services isolated from public exposure.
	•	This approach was agreed upon and also communicated by Richard.

Current Situation:
	•	We are in the process of enabling Cloud NAT, which is required to allow communication from cloud workloads to on-prem environments.
	•	Until Cloud NAT is fully configured and deployed, these workloads cannot reach on-prem resources.

Progress Update:
	•	The PR has been approved.
	•	Testing is already underway in the background, with rigorous validation to ensure every possible scenario is covered.
	•	Our goal is to avoid any future impact by proactively identifying and addressing edge cases during this phase.

Proposed Working Session – Network Diagrams

We need to schedule a working session to create the following:
	•	Topology Diagram
	•	Transit Connectivity Diagram
	•	Unified Diagram (optional)

For the Transit Diagram, we will need Preetam’s assistance, as he has previously demonstrated the cross-region connectivity. Currently, we have us-central1 and us-east1, and upcoming additions include us-south1 and us-east4.

The NCC diagram is already available with Dele.

This session will be scheduled based on the availability of team members from each group.

Tools to be used:
	•	Microsoft Visio (Office 365)
	•	Microsoft PowerPoint
