Here is a consolidated and professionally structured version of all the notes you‚Äôve provided, suitable for Confluence, internal documentation, or a Terraform module changelog.

üõ†Ô∏è Networking Terraform Module ‚Äì Change Summary

1. AD Group Role Binding Control
	‚Ä¢	In networking.tf (line 40), all relevant AD group IDs have been added.
	‚Ä¢	A single boolean flag now controls whether all IAM role bindings are applied.
	‚Ä¢	This is an ‚Äúall-or-nothing‚Äù toggle, enabled (true) by default.
	‚Ä¢	This is not meant for use in the upstream Google Landing Zone (LZ) model, where role binding is typically optional.
	‚Ä¢	The old role-binding code has been commented out to clearly show changes to the LZ team for easier diff review.

2. IAM Binding Behavior
	‚Ä¢	The update performs two actions:
	‚Ä¢	Deletes any previously applied role bindings, and
	‚Ä¢	Adds the appropriate service account(s) to the AD groups as per the new logic.
	‚Ä¢	This change enforces centralized group-based IAM control, improving manageability.

3. Host Project vs Subnet-Level Binding
	‚Ä¢	The roles/compute.networkUser is now the only IAM role applied at the subnet level, and only for shared subnets.
	‚Ä¢	All other roles continue to be bound at the host project level, as per standard practice.
	‚Ä¢	The previous binding of compute.networkUser at the host project level has been removed, as it‚Äôs not recommended.

4. GKE-specific Role Handling
	‚Ä¢	In the wf-custom module:
	‚Ä¢	The same service account used for GKE is now bound with roles/compute.networkUser at the subnet level, but only if GKE is enabled.
	‚Ä¢	GKE enablement is automatically detected by checking if the GKE API is active in the project.
	‚Ä¢	If active, a Terraform flag is set, and necessary subnet-level bindings are applied.
	‚Ä¢	This ensures principle of least privilege, especially in shared VPC setups.

5. Cloud Composer Enablement
	‚Ä¢	Cloud Composer is being enabled by default for all applicable projects as part of this configuration.

‚∏ª

6. Upstream Compatibility
	‚Ä¢	A separate version of the module is maintained for upstream compatibility, should the changes need to be merged with the Google-managed LZ modules in future.
