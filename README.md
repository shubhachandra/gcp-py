üõ∞Ô∏è Subnet Reclamation Framework

Purpose

This page documents the Subnet Reclamation Framework to recover unused subnet IP ranges across SDLC environments. The objective is to maintain a sustainable, efficient, and future-proof IP address management process in response to growing IP shortages.

‚∏ª

Background
	‚Ä¢	Our IP address pools are nearing exhaustion, impacting our ability to onboard new services such as GKE clusters, Composer, and AI Notebooks.
	‚Ä¢	A recent audit identified 230 unused subnets across SDLC environments.
	‚Ä¢	These subnets need to be reclaimed in a phased and controlled manner.

‚∏ª

Objectives

‚úÖ Optimize and recover valuable IP address ranges
‚úÖ Support faster provisioning of future workloads
‚úÖ Maintain a clean and secure network environment
‚úÖ Build a foundation for future automation

‚∏ª

Process Overview

Below is the detailed step-by-step process:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Subnet Usage Report Generation
	‚Ä¢	Daily subnet consumption reports generated from Grafana or equivalent
	‚Ä¢	Highlight subnets with no resources attached for 90+ days

‚∏ª

2Ô∏è‚É£ Candidate Subnet Shortlisting
	‚Ä¢	Networking team reviews the report
	‚Ä¢	Shortlists candidate subnets for potential reclamation

‚∏ª

3Ô∏è‚É£ App Team Validation
	‚Ä¢	Networking team directly contacts the application team
	‚Ä¢	Provides subnet details:
	‚Ä¢	Subnet name
	‚Ä¢	IP range
	‚Ä¢	SDLC environment
	‚Ä¢	Service project
	‚Ä¢	Days since last update
	‚Ä¢	Planned deletion timeline
	‚Ä¢	App team has 5 business days to respond with justification
	‚Ä¢	If no response and no active workloads, proceed with reclamation

‚∏ª

4Ô∏è‚É£ Delinking Subnet from Service Project

Important prerequisite step before deletion:
	‚Ä¢	The subnet must be delinked from its associated service project
	‚Ä¢	This is done in the project provisioning repository, involving:
	‚Ä¢	Update the repo
	‚Ä¢	Commit and push changes
	‚Ä¢	Raise a Pull Request (PR)
	‚Ä¢	Raise an intake request
	‚Ä¢	Ops team creates a CR (Change Request)
	‚Ä¢	CR approved, merged, and applied
	‚Ä¢	Only once delinked, proceed to subnet deletion

Estimated time per subnet (for delinking + reclaim flow): ~1 hour 30 minutes

‚∏ª

5Ô∏è‚É£ Subnet Reclamation (Delete)
	‚Ä¢	Network team raises an intake request for subnet deletion after delinking
	‚Ä¢	Ops team creates a CR for deletion of the subnet from Terraform
	‚Ä¢	CR is approved, merged, and applied
	‚Ä¢	Subnet is officially reclaimed

‚∏ª

Roles & Responsibilities

Team	Responsibilities
Networking	Identify candidates, contact app teams, validate, raise intake requests
Ops	Create CRs, approve/merge/apply changes
App Teams	Respond to validation emails within 5 business days


‚∏ª

Batching & Scheduling
	‚Ä¢	Initial volume: ~230 unused subnets
	‚Ä¢	Target: 15 subnets reclaimed per week (based on estimated processing effort)
	‚Ä¢	Proposed: dedicate one day per week (e.g., Wednesdays) for subnet reclamation
	‚Ä¢	CR lead times for production: currently 7 days
	‚Ä¢	Suggest to discuss possible lead time adjustment for faster execution

‚∏ª

Future Automation Vision

Long-term, the goal is to fully automate this end-to-end process, including:

‚úÖ Automated subnet reporting
‚úÖ Automated validation with app owners
‚úÖ Automated delinking workflow from the repo
‚úÖ Automated PR generation and intake request
‚úÖ Automated CR creation, approval, and apply
‚úÖ Integrated dashboards for tracking status
‚úÖ Audit trail and rollback support

‚∏ª

Milestones

Milestone	Target Sprint
Process design and stakeholder sign-off	Sprint X
Pilot batch of 15 subnets	Sprint X+1
Weekly cadence established	Sprint X+2
Reporting dashboard creation	Sprint X+3
Automation PoC planning	Sprint X+4
Automation rollout	Sprint X+5 onward


‚∏ª

Questions for Ops Team

1Ô∏è‚É£ Should subnet deletion intake requests be:
	‚Ä¢	one consolidated intake per SDLC
	‚Ä¢	or multiple intake requests per subnet?

2Ô∏è‚É£ Can we dedicate one weekday (Wednesday) for all subnet reclamation?

3Ô∏è‚É£ Would you support adjusting lead time (currently 7 days for production) if we dedicate a specific day for these activities?

4Ô∏è‚É£ Should we stick to 15 subnets per week or consider larger batch sizes?

‚∏ª

Next Steps

‚úÖ Gather Ops team feedback on above questions
‚úÖ Schedule a discussion meeting
‚úÖ Finalize the approach and stakeholder sign-off
‚úÖ Start pilot execution
