Absolutely — here’s a clear JIRA feature definition you can directly paste into a JIRA story or feature ticket, with milestones and a future automation plan included.

JIRA Feature Title:
Subnet Reclamation Framework and Automation Roadmap

⸻

Feature Description:
Implement a subnet reclamation framework to identify, validate, and reclaim subnets unused for more than 90 days to optimize IP address usage across SDLC environments. The initiative will start with a semi-manual process involving Ops and Network teams, with a roadmap to full automation.

⸻

Objectives:
	•	Reclaim idle subnets to free up scarce IP address resources
	•	Maintain a clean and efficient network environment
	•	Reduce time to provision new workloads
	•	Build a scalable framework to support future automation

⸻

Scope & Process Steps:

✅ Phase 1 (Manual with Process Coordination):
	•	Generate daily subnet usage reports (Grafana or equivalent)
	•	Network team shortlists candidate subnets
	•	Network team validates with application owners via email (5 business days SLA)
	•	Network team raises an intake request after validation
	•	Ops team creates the CR (change request) for subnet deletion
	•	Network team merges and applies changes via Terraform

✅ Phase 2 (Process Enhancements):
	•	Establish a weekly subnet reclaim day (e.g., Wednesdays)
	•	Agree on batch sizes (initially 50 per week)
	•	Track and report reclaimed subnet counts per sprint

✅ Phase 3 (Automation Roadmap):
	•	Automate subnet usage reporting and validation
	•	Automate intake request generation
	•	Automate CR creation and PR workflow
	•	Automate PR approval (where possible) and apply in Terraform
	•	Provide dashboards with status tracking of reclaim progress
	•	Implement audit logs for compliance

⸻

Milestones:

Milestone	Target Sprint
Process design and stakeholder sign-off	Sprint X
Initial pilot of 50 subnets	Sprint X+1
Weekly reclaim cadence implemented	Sprint X+2
Reporting dashboard created	Sprint X+3
Automation PoC planning	Sprint X+4
Automation rollout	Sprint X+5 onward


⸻

Acceptance Criteria:

✅ Subnet reclamation process is documented and signed off
✅ Communication templates are approved and shared
✅ Ops and Network teams aligned on intake/CR responsibilities
✅ Intake and CR handling confirmed for at least one SDLC
✅ Pilot reclaim of 50 subnets executed successfully
✅ Automation PoC requirements defined and ready for backlog

⸻

Future Automation Vision:
	•	A self-service reclaim dashboard for subnet owners
	•	Automated notifications with approval workflows
	•	Integration with Terraform pipelines for end-to-end subnet removal
	•	Policy-as-code rules to identify eligible subnets dynamically
	•	Automated rollback (if required)
