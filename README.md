"We propose creating a group profile where all relevant service accounts will be added as members. Now that the group is ready, it will be granted the roles/compute.networkUser role at the shared subnet levelâ€”this is a one-time setup handled by the networking team and should be included in the network subnet creation code. Adding service accounts to the group should be managed within the project provisioning code to ensure this action is performed automatically for every new project. This responsibility lies with the Landing Zone (LZ) team."
