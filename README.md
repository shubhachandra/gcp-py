**Subject:** Action Required: Repeated Senthil Policy Notifications

Hi Niguel,

As the Senthil policy notifications continue to come up repeatedly, we need to set up a call with the Cyber Security team to address this issue. Alternatively, we may need to escalate it, looping in Pankaj and Kincy.

Let’s also discuss this with Lopez to ensure the issue doesn’t recur—otherwise, it won’t reach a logical conclusion. This is the third time it's happening, despite us having provided the required evidence and sufficient reasoning during the last instance.

Can we inform the Cyber Security team collectively that this should be considered resolved and request a formal sign-off from them? This repetition must be avoided going forward.

Best regards,
\[Your Name]
