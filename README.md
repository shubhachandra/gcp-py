Subject: Introduction of Subnet Reclamation Process â€“ Ops Team Support & Clarification

â¸»

Hi Ops Team,

As part of our ongoing network hygiene and IP address optimization efforts, we are introducing a subnet reclamation process starting this sprint. This initiative will help us recover unused IP ranges to fulfill current and future provisioning demands, as our IP pool is nearing exhaustion.

â¸»

Process Overview

âœ… Networking Team responsibilities
	â€¢	Analyze subnet usage reports
	â€¢	Identify subnets unused for more than 90 days
	â€¢	Communicate directly with the application teams for validation
	â€¢	Raise intake requests with confirmed subnet details

âœ… Ops Team responsibilities
	â€¢	Create and manage the Change Requests (CRs) to remove these subnets from Terraform once the intake request is submitted
	â€¢	There is no need for the Ops team to reach out to application teams, as the Networking team will coordinate directly

Questions and Discussion Points for Ops

ðŸ‘‰ 1. Intake Request Strategy
Would you prefer to handle subnet deletions through:
	â€¢	one consolidated intake request per SDLC environment covering multiple subnets, or
	â€¢	separate intake requests for each subnet?

ðŸ‘‰ 2. Dedicated Reclamation Day
Can we dedicate one day of the week (e.g., every Wednesday) to process all subnet reclamation activities? This will help us streamline the process and build predictability into planning.

ðŸ‘‰ 3. Lead Time Adjustments
Since the lead time for CR approval is currently 7 days for production changes, can this be reviewed or optimized if we dedicate a specific day for this activity, to avoid unnecessary delays?

ðŸ‘‰ 4. Batch Strategy
We have currently identified around 230 unused subnets across SDLC environments.
	â€¢	We propose reclaiming these in batches of about 50 per week or per sprint to manage the workload.
	â€¢	Alternatively, would you suggest going all out in a single batch? Please share your preference.

ðŸ‘‰ 5. Future Automation Goal
Our future goal is to fully automate this process, including:
	â€¢	Subnet identification
	â€¢	PR creation
	â€¢	Intake request generation
	â€¢	CR creation
	â€¢	PR approval, merge, and apply
We will collaborate with you to build this pipeline in a phased approach.
