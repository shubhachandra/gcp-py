üîß Change Description Template ‚Äì Patch Solution 1: Remove Unnecessary Notebook Viewer Role

‚∏ª

1. Description:

This change involves removing the roles/notebooks.viewer IAM role from service accounts attached to specific Vertex AI notebook instances in sandbox, non-prod, and prod environments. These service accounts already possess roles/notebooks.runner, which includes the necessary permissions provided by the viewer role, making the viewer role redundant.
Target instances include those ending with 737c, abc9, and 89e7 in prod-ad-ent, and similarly configured notebooks in sandbox and non-prod.

‚∏ª

2. Change Justification:

The Prisma alerts are being triggered due to unnecessary elevated IAM permissions. The removal of the redundant role aligns with the principle of least privilege and ensures IAM compliance.

‚∏ª

3. Benefits and Impact if Not Implemented:

Benefits:
	‚Ä¢	Eliminates unnecessary IAM permissions
	‚Ä¢	Reduces Prisma security alert noise
	‚Ä¢	Improves compliance with internal IAM best practices

Impact if not implemented:
	‚Ä¢	Continuous Prisma alerts for non-compliant permissions
	‚Ä¢	Increased operational overhead in managing false positives
	‚Ä¢	Security posture deviation from least privilege principle

‚∏ª

4. Code Defects:

No code changes or defects are involved. This change is limited to IAM policy adjustments only.

‚∏ª

5. Alerting and Monitoring Adjustments:

No changes to application-level alerting/monitoring. Prisma alert status will be used to validate the effectiveness of the IAM role removal.

‚∏ª

6. Blast Radius:

Minimal. The changes only affect notebook instances‚Äô service accounts. Since roles/notebooks.runner remains intact, notebook functionality will not be impacted.

‚∏ª

7. Post-Change Validation and Checkout Plan:
	‚Ä¢	Post-change validation in sandbox with Prisma team to ensure alert suppression
	‚Ä¢	Verify notebook access and usability post IAM role removal
	‚Ä¢	Proceed with non-prod and prod changes only after successful validation

‚∏ª

8. Communications:
	‚Ä¢	Notify GCP IAM governance team, Prisma monitoring team
	‚Ä¢	Communicate change window and status via Slack/Teams channels used by Operations and Command Centers
	‚Ä¢	Include summary update in the daily change call

‚∏ª

9. High-Level Implementation Plan:
	1.	Identify service accounts with redundant roles
	2.	Create and approve PR to remove roles/notebooks.viewer
	3.	Apply changes to sandbox
	4.	Validate with Prisma team
	5.	Raise CR and apply changes to non-prod
	6.	Apply to prod with 2-day lead time post-approval

‚∏ª

10. Backout Plan:

If any issues arise, reassign the roles/notebooks.viewer role to the impacted service accounts via a rollback script or reapply the original IAM bindings.
Reference rollback steps: [Confluence/Runbook link or Git repo]

‚∏ª

11. Rollback Constraints:

No known constraints. IAM bindings can be re-applied without downtime.

‚∏ª

12. Fail-Forward:

No. This is not a fail-forward change. The system can be safely rolled back without impact.

‚∏ª

üì¶ Components Involved:
	‚Ä¢	Vertex AI Notebook Instances
	‚Ä¢	GCP IAM Policies
	‚Ä¢	Prisma Security Monitoring
	‚Ä¢	Change Management System (CR intake)
