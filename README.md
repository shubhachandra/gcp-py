Hereâ€™s a clear and professional breakdown in the format you requested, using the four columns:

What was the problem?	What did we do?	What was the impact?	Additional commentary
Non-prod deployments were failing due to hitting the Google policy binding limit (1500), a hard limit imposed by GCP.	The networking team analyzed the error and proposed using a group to manage network user role bindings instead of assigning the role to each service agent individually. We created a custom repository in the project-factory module to add service accounts to the group.	This solution unblocked non-prod deployments, which in turn allowed us to proceed with production deployments, as non-prod validation is a prerequisite.	We collaborated with the IAM team to create the group and assign the Terraform service account as owner. We also engaged the Landing Zone team to review and approve the solution and test the custom module.
