The subnet reclamation process has officially taken flight! We’ve connected with 11 application IDs so far and received approvals to reclaim 15 subnets. We’ve also raised change requests (CRs) for a few of them. Our automation is in place — scripts are now generating pull requests and intake requests across both the networking spoke repositories and the project provisioning repository, streamlining the entire workflow.

🧭 Career Roadmap

🧩 1. Technical Depth and Certifications (Next 3–6 months)

You’ve mentioned aiming for GCP certifications. Build credibility in security and architecture.

🎯 Goals:
	•	✅ Complete 2 advanced GCP certs:
	•	Professional Cloud Network Engineer (deep dive into hybrid, VPCs, firewall, Cloud Armor)
	•	Professional Cloud Security Engineer (secure networking, IAM, DLP, VPC-SC)
	•	Bonus: GCP Generative AI Leader (cloud+AI mix is in demand)
	•	Deepen practical expertise in:
	•	Cloud NAT, Private Service Connect, Hybrid Interconnect, Firewall rules, Hub & spoke networking (VPC peering, Transit Gateway alternatives)
	•	Service networking + DNS peering & split horizon DNS (for LZ setups)

⸻

📦 2. Platform Maturity & Landing Zone Contributions

You’re in the Landing Zone ecosystem. Contribute or drive improvements.

🎯 Goals:
	•	Lead or co-drive initiatives like:
	•	Policy-as-code implementation (Org policies, Forseti, Config Validator)
	•	Networking guardrails (shared VPCs, hierarchical firewall policies)
	•	DR & failover designs for GCP networking
	•	Propose enhancements around:
	•	Automation modules using Terraform/CDM
	•	Service Directory/Service Mesh adoption
	•	SD-WAN/VPN + Interconnect optimizations

⸻

📡 3. Cross-Cloud & Hybrid Networking Strategy

Given your senior’s manager covers Azure & GCP, positioning yourself across clouds will be strategic.

🎯 Goals:
	•	Understand Azure networking parallels (VNet, NSG, UDRs, Azure Firewall, Private Link)
	•	Propose common governance or DR strategy across Azure-GCP
	•	Document and communicate multi-cloud patterns

⸻

🤝 4. Team Collaboration & Leadership

You’re surrounded by diverse talent—onshore/offshore, lead, principal.

🎯 Goals:
	•	Mentor junior engineers (design reviews, tech sessions)
	•	Take ownership of one area (e.g., DNS strategy, firewall automation, or PSC interface pattern)
	•	Propose reusable Terraform modules / CICD pipelines

⸻

📣 5. Influence & Visibility

You report into a technical hierarchy; positioning your work strategically helps long-term.

🎯 Goals:
	•	Present quarterly tech talks (internally)
	•	Propose cross-team PoCs: e.g., PSC to Vertex AI, interconnect to on-prem
	•	Contribute to internal networking best practices documentation

⸻

🧱 Long-Term Career Goal Options (12–36 months)

🔵 Option A: Principal Engineer / Staff Engineer

Own architecture for cross-region, multi-project networking, zero-trust, and platform automation.

🟣 Option B: GCP Networking Architect

Deep dive into multi-cloud hybrid connectivity, become the go-to for all network architecture decisions across GCP/Azure.

🟢 Option C: Cloud Platform Lead / Cloud Center of Excellence

Contribute toward defining enterprise-wide landing zones, governance models, cost optimization, and DevSecOps enablement.

⸻

✅ Summary Plan for Next Quarter

Area	Goal
📘 Certification	Complete GCP Network + Security Engineer
🚀 Projects	Own one cross-cutting infra initiative (e.g., DNS, firewall automation)
📡 Cross-cloud	Start Azure networking alignment learning
🤝 Team Dev	Mentor one junior or offshore engineer
📣 Visibility	Present 1 internal tech session or share reusables
