**Title:** Request to Align PROD AD-ent with QA-ent to Eliminate Technical Debt

**Description:**
I would like to request an initiative to align the **PROD AD-ent** environment with **QA-ent**, which it is intended to mirror. During recent work in PROD, we identified significant technical debt and discrepancies when compared to QA-ent. These differences could introduce risks and inconsistencies between environments.

**Request Details:**

* Please conduct a comparison between QA-ent and PROD AD-ent.
* Identify and document key differences (e.g., configurations, group policies, OU structures, permissions, etc.).
* Based on findings, update PROD AD-ent to ensure it mirrors QA-ent.
* Optionally, we can explore setting up automated checks or documentation to maintain alignment going forward.

**Reason for Request:**

* Reduce technical debt and configuration drift.
* Ensure consistency and reliability across environments.
* Enable smoother and safer rollout of changes tested in QA.

**Suggested Timeline:** \[Insert preferred date or sprint if applicable]

Please let me know if further inputs or validations are needed from my end.

Thanks,
\[Your Name]
