Got it 👍 You want a comprehensive observability view for GCP networking that includes what metrics/logs to monitor, what to capture in dashboards, and what anomalies to focus on. I’ll break it down by each component in your environment and then suggest dashboard categories + anomalies.

⸻

🔎 What to Monitor in GCP Networking

1. VPC & Subnets
	•	Resource inventory: number of VPCs, subnets, IP utilization.
	•	Subnet utilization: used vs. available IPs.
	•	Flow logs:
	•	Top talkers (src/dst IPs, bytes, packets).
	•	Denied connections.
	•	Latency & retransmissions.
	•	Routing changes: unexpected changes in routes, blackhole routes.

⸻

2. Firewalls
	•	Firewall rule usage (hit count from firewall logs).
	•	Denied vs allowed traffic (esp. denied hits from unexpected sources).
	•	Shadowed / redundant rules detection.
	•	High volume drops → possible attack or misconfig.

⸻

3. Private Service Connect (PSC)
	•	PSC Endpoints:
	•	Endpoint connection status (healthy/unhealthy).
	•	Connection latency, throughput.
	•	Unauthorized or rejected connections.
	•	PSC Backends:
	•	Health of backend services.
	•	Load distribution.
	•	Connection failures.

⸻

4. Cloud NAT
	•	Active connections per NAT gateway.
	•	SNAT port utilization (exhaustion risk).
	•	Translation errors/drops.
	•	Throughput & latency.

⸻

5. Network Connectivity Center (NCC) & NCC NAT
	•	NCC hub/spoke health.
	•	On-prem → cloud tunnel status (BGP session up/down, latency).
	•	NCC NAT metrics (similar to Cloud NAT).
	•	Route advertisements (unexpected route leaks).

⸻

6. Cloud DNS
	•	Query volume (QPS).
	•	Top queried domains.
	•	NXDOMAIN/ServFail rates.
	•	Latency in DNS resolution.
	•	Unauthorized zones or spoofing attempts.

⸻

7. Interconnect
	•	Link utilization (in/out traffic).
	•	BGP session status.
	•	CRC/FCS errors on link.
	•	Packet drops or high latency.
	•	Failover events (link down, switch to backup).

⸻

8. Service Directory
	•	Service registration changes.
	•	Unhealthy endpoints.
	•	Orphaned services (no backends).

⸻

9. Load Balancers (External & Internal)
	•	Request count / latency / throughput.
	•	Backend health checks (pass/fail).
	•	5xx error rates.
	•	SSL/TLS certificate expiry.
	•	Connection drops or resets.
	•	Geo-distribution of traffic (sudden shift might indicate attack).

📊 Suggested Dashboards

Organize dashboards by layers:
	1.	Traffic Flow & Connectivity
	•	Top talkers, flows, allowed vs denied traffic.
	•	Latency, packet drops.
	•	Interconnect/NCC link status.
	2.	Resource Utilization
	•	Subnet IP usage.
	•	NAT SNAT port utilization.
	•	Interconnect bandwidth.
	3.	Security Posture
	•	Denied firewall hits.
	•	Unexpected PSC or LB connections.
	•	DNS anomalies (high NXDOMAIN, spoofing).
	4.	Service Health
	•	LB backend health.
	•	PSC backend availability.
	•	DNS resolution success.
	5.	Change & Drift Monitoring
	•	New VPCs, subnets, firewall rules.
	•	BGP route changes.
	•	Service Directory updates.

⸻

⚠️ Key Anomalies to Watch
	•	VPC/Subnets: sudden IP exhaustion, unusual east-west traffic, unexpected route ads.
	•	Firewalls: spike in denied traffic, unused rules (possible misconfig).
	•	PSC: endpoint disconnects, backend flaps.
	•	NAT (Cloud/NCC): port exhaustion, translation errors, connection drops.
	•	NCC/Interconnect: BGP flaps, link congestion >80%, packet loss >1%.
	•	DNS: spikes in NXDOMAIN (typo-squatting, malware C2), latency >100ms.
	•	Load Balancers: backend failure spikes, 5xx > 1%, traffic imbalance.
	•	Certificates: expiring LB certs not rotated.
	•	Security: DDoS patterns, data exfiltration (large outbound flows to unusual IPs).

👉 This setup would give you end-to-end observability for GCP networking: infra health, traffic visibility, utilization, and security posture.

Do you want me to also map this to specific GCP Monitoring metrics/logs (e.g., metric names like loadbalancing.googleapis.com/..., dns.googleapis.com/...) so you can plug directly into Cloud Monitoring dashboards/alerts?
