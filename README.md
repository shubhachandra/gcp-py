Here's a structured Jira description template to request creation of **3 repositories and 3 workspaces** in **AD-ENT** for vendor-neutral firewall infrastructure management and deployment (currently targeting Palo Alto), answering each of the required questions:

### **Jira Title**

**Create 3 Git Repositories and Workspaces for Firewall Infrastructure Projects in AD-ENT**

---

### **Change Description:**

#### 1. **Description:**

We propose to create the following 3 repositories and their corresponding workspaces in the AD-ENT organization:

* **Repo & Workspace 1**: `firewall-vm-deployment` – for VM-based firewall deployment configurations.
* **Repo & Workspace 2**: `firewall-infra-resources` – for general infrastructure resource provisioning related to firewall deployments.
* **Repo & Workspace 3**: `firewall-security-appliance` (Workspace: `firewall-security-management`) – for firewall security policies, shared modules, and appliance configuration management.

These repositories will enable modular and environment-specific deployments and support automation pipelines for provisioning and configuration. While the current use case involves Palo Alto firewalls, the design is vendor-neutral for future extensibility.

---

#### 2. **Change Justification:**

The existing firewall-related infrastructure components are spread across multiple repositories without a clear separation of deployment, infra, and security policy logic. This initiative aims to organize the codebase, align with IaC best practices, and enable clean pipelines for each concern area.

Additionally, Palo Alto has recently become the focal point of firewall deployment; however, by using abstracted modules, we intend to remain vendor-agnostic.

---

#### 3. **Benefits and Impact if Not Implemented:**

**Benefits:**

* Improved CI/CD pipeline manageability.
* Modular repository structure simplifies ownership, auditing, and scaling.
* Enables vendor-neutral policy management.

**Impact if not implemented:**

* Code complexity and risk of misconfiguration.
* Delay in automation and deployment of firewall appliances.
* Lack of clear separation between security management and VM deployment.

---

#### 4. **Known Defects in Code Deployment:**

No known defects are present at the time of repository and workspace creation. The repositories will be initialized with baseline `README.md` files and empty Terraform module structures. Further commits will follow a standard PR review process.

---

#### 5. **Alerting and Monitoring Adjustments:**

No immediate alerting or monitoring changes as this is an initial repository and workspace creation. However, pipeline-level alerts will be configured once GitOps workflows are defined and integrated.

---

#### 6. **Blast Radius (Client or System Impact if Failed):**

As this change only involves creation of new repositories and workspaces with no immediate deployment, there is **no impact** on any production systems or clients. This is a preparatory action.

---

#### 7. **Post-Change Validation Plan:**

* Verify successful creation of repositories and workspaces in AD-ENT.
* Validate appropriate permissions and branching policies.
* Confirm workspace integration with Terraform Cloud backend (if applicable).
* Conduct initial dummy plan/test to ensure the workspace is operational.

---

#### 8. **Communication Plan:**

* Notify DevOps team and Infra-as-Code (IaC) stakeholders post repository and workspace creation.
* Update Confluence documentation with repository structure and usage guidelines.
* Notify Network and Security Operations teams to align future contributions.

---

#### 9. **High-Level Implementation Plan:**

1. Create 3 repositories under the AD-ENT GitHub organization.
2. Create corresponding Terraform Cloud workspaces.
3. Apply repository-level access policies and branch protections.
4. Add `README.md` and `.gitignore` files to initialize repositories.
5. Configure baseline `main.tf` files and backend configurations.
6. Validate all actions with project leads.

---

#### 10. **Backout Process (High-Level):**

Repositories and workspaces can be archived or deleted from the UI or CLI if required. No code or environment changes are involved.
Detailed GitHub and Terraform Cloud backout documentation is maintained under \[Confluence → Repo Management → Archive/Delete Process].

---

#### 11. **Rollback Limitations:**

No limitations as no production systems are affected. Rollback simply involves deleting the created repositories and workspaces.

---

#### 12. **Fail-Forward Deployment:**

No. This is not a fail-forward deployment. Change is incremental and reversible at each step.

---

### **Components:**

* GitHub: AD-ENT Organization
* Terraform Cloud: Workspace Configuration
* Firewall Automation
* Network Infrastructure
* Security Policy Management
