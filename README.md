### **Feature Update**

**Title:** Enable `us-east4` Region in GCP for Cloud Workloads
**Role:** Cloud Networking Engineer

---

**Description:**
As a **Cloud Networking Engineer**, I want to **enable the `us-east4` region in GCP** so that **application teams can deploy workloads closer to users in the eastern United States**, thereby improving **performance, redundancy, and scalability**.

---

**Business Driver / OKR (Value Statement & Outcome):**

* **Improved Performance:** Reduces latency by placing workloads geographically closer to users on the East Coast.
* **Enhanced Disaster Recovery:** Adds an additional region for failover, strengthening business continuity and resilience.
* **Scalability:** Increases capacity for future growth in a high-demand region.
* **Compliance & Regulatory Support:** Supports workloads requiring data residency in the eastern U.S., aligning with specific regulatory and compliance needs.

---

**Milestones:**

* **Pending:** Awaiting written confirmation of implementation timelines from the SNS team.
* **Planned:** Region enablement to be carried out in coordination with **PBGPL-3** project deliverables.
