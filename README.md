I accept the fault as the approver. I should have been more cautious while approving the changes. I did not follow the required process for handling sandbox and non-prod environments, especially regarding the necessary validation and time gap between the changes. I mistakenly approved both changes simultaneously, which was an error on my part.

My understanding while approving the PR was that the change would recreate the existing notebook instances and provision new ones in us-south1 and us-east1, without any data loss or disk deletion. The challenge arose from the fact that the existing instances were user-managed notebooks, which have been marked for deprecation for months now.

However, I failed to realize that the changes would not recreate or replace the existing user-managed notebooks, but rather maintain them as-is. The action taken eventually led to a force deletion. While a single environment error may have been manageable, executing the changes for both non-prod and sandbox environments simultaneously was a serious oversight.

Let me know if you want a more formal or informal version, or if this is meant to be used in a specific setting like a postmortem or email.
