Got it. Here’s the updated Jira request focusing only on deleting the existing PSC subnet, with clear justification:

Title:
Request to Delete Existing PSC Subnet in [PROJECT_NAME] VPC

Description:
We request the deletion of the existing Private Service Connect (PSC) subnet in the [PROJECT_NAME] VPC. This subnet is no longer required as we have already provisioned a new subnet with updated IP ranges to support our current and future PSC use cases.

Subnet Details to be Deleted:
	•	Subnet Name: [SUBNET_NAME]
	•	Region: [REGION]
	•	CIDR Range: [e.g., 10.10.0.0/29]

Justification:
	•	The subnet was previously used for PSC endpoint IP allocations, but we have moved to a new, better-aligned subnet based on revised IP planning.
	•	Retaining this subnet may lead to confusion or accidental usage, potentially causing routing or allocation conflicts.
	•	Cleaning up unused network resources improves GCP hygiene and reduces administrative overhead.

Impact:
No production impact is expected, as all PSC configurations have been updated to use the new subnet.
