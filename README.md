Got it! Here‚Äôs your revised paragraph using future tense appropriately and maintaining clarity:

‚∏ª

The user will request access to use BigQuery notebooks. To support this, they will create a Vertex AI Workbench instance, which will run on a virtual machine and require access to subnets. For the service to use these subnets, the compute.networkUser role will be needed to read and attach them.

Since IAM roles cannot be assigned directly to individual users, all role assignments will be handled through AD groups. This PR will assign the compute.networkUser role to the appropriate AD group, ensuring compliance with our access control policies.

We have previously made similar changes in the networking repository to resolve policy binding errors, with support from the Ops team. The compute.networkUser role is already used by the Project Factory and is actively leveraged by subnet-related AD groups.

‚úÖ Justification for Terraform Local Variable Change

Context:

We are renaming a Terraform local variable from:

default_subnet

to:

sdlc_wide_shared_subnets

Clarification on Resource Impact:
	‚Ä¢	This is a local variable rename only, used to improve clarity and maintainability of the code.
	‚Ä¢	Local variables do not directly define or reference resources. They are internal expressions, so renaming the local itself will not cause any resource deletion or recreation unless the values or usage elsewhere in resource blocks change.
	‚Ä¢	The values inside the variable (list of fully qualified subnet names) remain unchanged, hence Terraform plan should show no changes to infrastructure.

Reason for the Rename:
	‚Ä¢	The variable name default_subnet is ambiguous and misleading.
	‚Ä¢	The new name sdlc_wide_shared_subnets:
	‚Ä¢	Reflects the purpose more clearly ‚Äî shared subnets across SDLC environments.
	‚Ä¢	Aligns with naming conventions for clarity in multi-team collaboration.

‚úÖ Justification for Subnet Access for AI Notebook Creation (ClickOps)

Business Need:
	‚Ä¢	Data Analysts and Data Engineers need to perform various tasks like:
	‚Ä¢	Running AI/ML code
	‚Ä¢	Testing data pipelines
	‚Ä¢	Experimentation using Vertex AI Workbench (AI Notebooks)
	‚Ä¢	This is required as part of their daily development and exploration workflows.

Environment Scope:
	‚Ä¢	All activities are strictly limited to the ad-ent (Analytics Development - Enterprise) environment.
	‚Ä¢	No access is required in QA, PROD, or other environments.

Access Implementation Plan:
	‚Ä¢	We are granting subnet-level permissions to specific IAM groups.
	‚Ä¢	Only engineers who are added to these groups will be able to create notebooks using the shared subnets.
	‚Ä¢	This is a least-privilege model where access is controlled through group membership.

Why No QA Testing is Required:
	‚Ä¢	This change only affects IAM policy bindings, not infrastructure creation.
	‚Ä¢	No runtime workload or data pipeline is involved.
	‚Ä¢	The risk is minimal and bounded to controlled access.
	‚Ä¢	Terraform will validate bindings during plan/apply phase.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Summary:
	‚Ä¢	The variable rename is safe and does not trigger resource changes.
	‚Ä¢	The access control update enables critical data engineering use cases in a secure and scoped manner.
	‚Ä¢	No QA testing is needed, as changes are limited to permissions and do not impact infrastructure behavior or deployment logic.

Let me know if you‚Äôd like this as a PR description, email response, or added to a Terraform change ticket.
Great point. To address the Ops team‚Äôs overhead and build a business justification for requesting a dedicated Subnet Reclaim Team or function, here‚Äôs a proposal you can use with leadership or program management.

‚∏ª

üîß Proposal: Dedicated Subnet Reclaim Support Team

üìå Current Challenge
	‚Ä¢	Subnet reclaim requires multi-team coordination, including:
	‚Ä¢	Analysis (Network team)
	‚Ä¢	Outreach (currently done by Ops)
	‚Ä¢	Intake request creation
	‚Ä¢	Terraform PR and apply
	‚Ä¢	Ops team is already resource-constrained, and this adds significant overhead:
	‚Ä¢	Time spent identifying owners
	‚Ä¢	Chasing app teams for confirmation
	‚Ä¢	Managing ticket lifecycle

‚∏ª

üß© Request: Form a Dedicated Subnet Reclaim Coordination Team

üõ† Proposed Roles of the Dedicated Team
	‚Ä¢	Act as a liaison between network, app, and ops teams.
	‚Ä¢	Handle all communication with application owners.
	‚Ä¢	Create and track intake requests.
	‚Ä¢	Maintain the subnet reclaim tracker/dashboard.
	‚Ä¢	Coordinate Terraform PR workflow in collaboration with Infra-as-Code team.

‚∏ª

üìà Business Justification / Advantages

Area	Benefit
IP Space Optimization	Frees up unused subnets, preventing IP exhaustion in long-running projects (e.g., for GKE/Composer).
Network Hygiene	Reduces clutter of orphaned subnets, improving routing and firewall clarity.
Faster Provisioning	Minimizes wait time for new subnet allocation, avoiding unnecessary /18 or /16 expansions.
Ops Efficiency	Removes non-core workload from Ops, letting them focus on provisioning and incident handling.
Audit Readiness	Maintains clean inventory with ownership validation and deletion records.
Automation Readiness	Helps build patterns that could later be partially or fully automated.


‚∏ª

üìÜ Suggested Timeline and SLAs

Stage	Duration
Report reviewed by network team	Day 1‚Äì2
Shortlist sent to reclaim team	Day 3
App team contacted	Day 4
App team response window	Day 4‚Äì9 (5 business days)
Intake request raised	Day 10
Terraform PR created and merged	Day 11‚Äì13
Apply changes	Day 14
Final confirmation and update	Day 15

‚è±Ô∏è Total Timeline per reclaim cycle: ~15 calendar days (~2 weeks)

‚∏ª

üßÆ Resource Estimation for Dedicated Team

Assuming ~50 reclaimable subnets per month:
	‚Ä¢	1 FTE (full-time equivalent) can manage:
	‚Ä¢	Communication & tracking
	‚Ä¢	2‚Äì3 subnet reclaims per day
	‚Ä¢	Status updates and intake processing
	‚Ä¢	Can be part of a Network Ops or Infra Governance team.

‚∏ª

üìù Suggested Action Items
	1.	Present to Infra/Cloud leadership.
	2.	Define a pilot phase (e.g., reclaim effort across 2 SDLCs).
	3.	Track reclaimed IPs vs. effort hours for ROI tracking.
	4.	Formalize the reclaim cycle into a monthly hygiene task.
