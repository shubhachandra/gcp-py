I wanted to check if there are any upcoming plans or considerations from the networking team regarding investment in inter-cloud connectivity, particularly interconnect solutions between Azure and GCP.

We are observing a steady increase in multi-cloud workloads, especially with services like Apigee X and Apigee Hybrid that span across both platforms. Given this growing demand, it would be helpful to understand whether inter-cloud networking enhancements are on the roadmap to support such hybrid deployments efficiently.
