**Title:** Align PROD AD-ent with QA-ent to Eliminate Technical Debt

**Description:**
While working with the **PROD AD-ent** environment, we observed significant technical debt and configuration drift when compared to **QA-ent**, which it is supposed to mirror. This inconsistency is leading to environment-specific issues and risks to production stability.

**Issue Summary:**

* PROD AD-ent is not in sync with QA-ent.
* Differences include \[add a few specific examples if known, e.g., group policies, OU structure, permissions, etc.].
* These deviations are causing potential reliability and maintenance challenges.

**Proposed Action:**

* Perform a thorough comparison between QA-ent and PROD AD-ent.
* Document all configuration differences.
* Align PROD AD-ent to mirror QA-ent (or vice versa, based on what is the intended baseline).
* Establish ongoing configuration sync checks to prevent future drift.

**Impact if Unresolved:**

* Increased troubleshooting time.
* Risk of environment-specific failures.
* Harder rollout of changes validated in QA.

**Priority:** High
