Description:
The subnet is used for provisioning non-managed notebook instances using ClickOps.

Change Justification:
This will enable Data Engineers and AI Engineers to create their own non-managed notebooks, supporting a self-service model.

What are the benefits of implementing this change and the impact if this change is not implemented?:
It removes the dependency on the Ops team for creating non-managed notebooks. If not implemented, it could lead to operational overhead.

What customer or clients could be impacted ("blast radius") if the change does not go as planned?:
Data and AI Engineers may experience reduced productivity due to delays in notebook provisioning.
