✅ Makes sense — let’s make it as obvious and self-documenting as possible, so any team member immediately knows what each repo/workspace does, even years later.

Here’s a crystal-clear, plain-language naming scheme:

⸻

1️⃣ Firewall Virtual Machines
	•	Name: firewall-vm-deployment
	•	➡️ “firewall” makes it clear, “vm” specifies virtual appliances, “deployment” is action-oriented

2️⃣ Firewall Infrastructure Resources
	•	Name: firewall-infra-resources
	•	➡️ “infra” for infrastructure, “resources” is broader than “management” and covers subnets, routes, IPs, etc.

3️⃣ Firewall Security Policies
	•	Name: firewall-security-policies
	•	➡️ “security policies” is explicit, no vendor mention, universally understood

⸻

✅ Summary Table

Purpose	Suggested Name
Virtual firewall appliance setup	firewall-vm-deployment
Infra pieces supporting firewalls	firewall-infra-resources
Firewall rules & security configs	firewall-security-policies


⸻

✅ Why these are obvious?
	•	Consistently start with firewall
	•	Use clear, familiar words (vm, infra, policies)
	•	Work for any future vendor
	•	Easily understood by anyone who reads them, no acronyms to decode

If you want, I can also draft a short naming convention doc you could add to your README to explain these — just say the word!

Title: Create Terraform Workspace and Git Repository for Palo Alto Networks and GCP Policy Management

Description:
Request to create the required Terraform workspace(s) and Git repository(ies) for managing Palo Alto Networks deployment and GCP policy management.

Details:

✅ For Palo Alto Networks Implementation
	•	Terraform Workspace:
	•	pan-fw-deployment (or another agreed name)
	•	Git Repository:
	•	terraform-paloalto

✅ For GCP Policy Management
	•	Terraform Workspace:
	•	gcp-policy-mgmt (or another agreed name)
	•	Git Repository:
	•	terraform-gcp-policy

Requirements:
	•	Link the workspaces to their respective Git repositories
	•	Ensure appropriate workspace variables are configured (e.g., GCP service account credentials, PAN API keys, etc.)
	•	Apply standard policies (e.g., Sentinel policies, workspace permissions)
	•	Set up branch protection rules in Git if required
	•	Confirm the workspace connects successfully to version control

Acceptance Criteria:
	•	Workspaces created and tested with a sample Terraform plan
	•	Git repositories initialized and connected
	•	Permissions and access controls reviewed and approved

Priority: High

If you want, I can help you expand this into subtasks for things like Sentinel policies or variable configuration — just say the word!
