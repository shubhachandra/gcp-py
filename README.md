**Subject:** \[Action Required] Subnet Usage Verification for Reclamation

Hi Team,

I am writing on behalf of the Networking team. As you know, IP addresses are limited and valuable resources. We have identified the following subnets that have not been used for more than 90 days. We would like to **reclaim** these subnets to optimize our IP address space.

Could you please review these subnets and confirm whether you still require them? If so, kindly provide a valid justification for retaining them.

Below are the details of the subnets, which are currently shared with the projects belonging to your team:

\[Insert subnet/project details table here, for example:]

| **Subnet Name** | **Region**  | **CIDR Range** | **Project ID** | **Creation Date**  | **Last Modified**  |
| --------------- | ----------- | -------------- | -------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| \[subnet-1]     | \[region-1] | \[cidr-1]      | \[project-1]   | \[creation-date-1] | \[last-modified-1] |

**Important:**

* Please respond within **5 business days** with your confirmation or justification.
* If no response is received within this time frame, and no active dependencies are identified, we will assume the subnet is safe to delete and proceed with reclamation.

Thank you for your prompt cooperation in maintaining a clean and efficient network environment. Please let us know if you have any questions.

Best regards,
\[Your Name]
Networking Team
