### ✅ Suggested Revised Response:

Hi Team,

There are typically two ways to connect to BigQuery from an internal network:

1. **Via a corporate proxy**, which handles outbound traffic securely.
2. **By allowing direct access to BigQuery endpoints**, such as `https://bigquery.googleapis.com`, bypassing any SSL inspection or interception.

The error observed (`SSL peer certificate or SSH remote key was not OK`) is an **SSL certificate validation issue** happening on the **client side**. This typically occurs when:

* A proxy is intercepting SSL traffic and presenting an untrusted certificate.
* The client's system does not trust the root/intermediate certificate being used.
* The local certificate store is outdated or incorrectly configured.

Richard has already spoken directly with the application team to explain the root cause. From our side (GCP/networking/ops), there is **no further action possible**, as this issue is entirely related to how the client system handles SSL certificates.

To resolve this:

* The application team needs to **ensure the certificate presented by the proxy is trusted**, or
* **Bypass the proxy** for BigQuery endpoints if possible.

Please let us know if any clarification is needed, but just to reiterate, this must be addressed on the **client or application network side**.

Thanks,
\[Your Name or Team Name]
