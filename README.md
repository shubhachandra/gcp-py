Nice — below are two ready-to-run Python patterns you can copy, adapt and run immediately with your BlueCat IP / username / password.
	1.	a minimal requests-based approach (works against the Gateway REST POST /rest_login flow), and
	2.	a more “official” approach that uses BlueCat’s bluecat-libraries Python package / client (recommended for more advanced BAM operations).

I’ve also included a small config file example (YAML) and error handling.

Minimal requests example (REST login + a simple GET)

This talks directly to BlueCat Gateway’s REST rest_login endpoint to obtain a session token, then uses it for further calls. BlueCat docs show POST /rest_login returning {"access_token": "<token>"} and subsequent requests must include the header auth: Basic <token>.  ￼

Save this as e.g. bluecat_simple.py and update config.yml (example below).

# bluecat_simple.py
import requests
import yaml
import sys

# Load config (see example config.yml below)
with open("config.yml") as f:
    cfg = yaml.safe_load(f)

GATEWAY = cfg['gateway']           # e.g. "https://10.0.0.5"
USERNAME = cfg['username']
PASSWORD = cfg['password']
VERIFY_TLS = cfg.get('verify', True)  # set False for self-signed certs (not recommended)

def login():
    url = f"{GATEWAY.rstrip('/')}/rest_login"
    payload = {"username": USERNAME, "password": PASSWORD}
    try:
        r = requests.post(url, json=payload, verify=VERIFY_TLS, timeout=15)
        r.raise_for_status()
    except Exception as e:
        print("Login failed:", e)
        sys.exit(1)
    data = r.json()
    token = data.get("access_token")
    if not token:
        print("No access_token in response:", data)
        sys.exit(1)
    return token

def get_something(token, path="/rest/endpoint/example"):
    # example call — replace path with a real API path (see BAM REST docs)
    url = f"{GATEWAY.rstrip('/')}{path}"
    headers = {"auth": f"Basic {token}"}
    r = requests.get(url, headers=headers, verify=VERIFY_TLS, timeout=15)
    r.raise_for_status()
    return r.json()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    t = login()
    # Example: fetch BAM configurations or other REST endpoints as required
    try:
        result = get_something(t, "/rest/v1/configuration")   # adjust endpoint to your BAM version
        print("Result:", result)
    except Exception as e:
        print("Request failed:", e)

config.yml example:

gateway: "https://BLUECAT_GATEWAY_OR_IP"   # e.g. https://10.0.0.5
username: "your_username"
password: "your_password"
verify: false   # set true if certs are valid; False useful for lab/self-signed (less secure)

Notes:
	•	The Gateway rest_login flow and auth: Basic <token> header are documented by BlueCat.  ￼
	•	Replace the example get_something endpoint with a real endpoint for your BlueCat version (v1 or v2). BlueCat has both legacy v1 and RESTful v2 APIs; v2 is preferred when available.  ￼

Using BlueCat’s official Python library (bluecat-libraries)

BlueCat provides a Python library / clients (bluecat-libraries) that wrap BAM REST v1/v2 operations — recommended for serious scripts (it handles auth, tokens, helpful wrappers). You can install the published package and then use the Client / BAMAPI classes.  ￼

Example (install first: pip install bluecat-libraries):

# bluecat_client_example.py
from bluecat_libraries.address_manager.api import Client
import yaml
import sys

with open("config.yml") as f:
    cfg = yaml.safe_load(f)

BAM_URL = cfg['bam_url']   # e.g. "https://10.0.0.5"
USERNAME = cfg['username']
PASSWORD = cfg['password']
VERIFY = cfg.get('verify', True)

def main():
    # The Client class constructor: Client(url, verify=True)
    client = Client(BAM_URL, verify=VERIFY)
    try:
        # login returns token/handles session internally; method names may differ by library version
        client.login(USERNAME, PASSWORD)
    except Exception as e:
        print("Login failed:", e)
        sys.exit(1)

    # Example: get list of configurations (wrapper method names vary by version)
    try:
        configs = client.get_configurations()   # example wrapper — check your library version docs
        print("Configurations:", configs)
    except Exception as e:
        print("API call failed:", e)
    finally:
        try:
            client.logout()
        except Exception:
            pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Important:
	•	The exact class/method names and whether you use v1 vs v2 client depend on your BAM/Gateway versions — the BlueCat docs show how to use the REST v2 client (recommended) or v1 legacy client; the bluecat-libraries package contains both. Check the API reference for your BlueCat release.  ￼

⸻

Which approach to pick?
	•	Quick scripting / labs: use the requests approach above.
	•	Production / more features (creating/deleting objects, using wrappers): prefer bluecat-libraries / the Client classes. BlueCat themselves recommend REST v2 and provide a Python client for it.  ￼

⸻

Troubleshooting tips
	•	If you get TLS/SSL errors and you’re on a private lab appliance, verify: False helps during testing but avoid in production.
	•	If you see endpoints failing, check whether your Gateway is configured to proxy to the BAM URL you’re calling — Gateway sometimes requires a bam_alias in login JSON for multi-BAM setups. Example login payload may include "bam_alias": "my bam".  ￼
	•	BlueCat docs and examples (Gateway workflows, REST v1/v2 examples) are on BlueCat’s documentation site and BlueCat Labs GitHub (gateway-workflows).  ￼

⸻

If you want, I can:
	•	generate a ready-to-download script with configurable command-line flags, or
	•	adapt the code to a specific BlueCat endpoint you need (e.g., create host record, fetch configuration list) — tell me which API action you want and I’ll provide the exact request body and example.1. IAM Policy Binding Quota Issue

Situation:
In March 2025, project creation and application onboarding were blocked due to hitting the IAM policy member binding quota limits in multiple projects.

My Contribution:
I investigated the root cause, explained the quota limitation and its business impact, and proposed both tactical (cleanup of unused bindings) and strategic (migration to group-based IAM bindings) solutions. I also worked closely with application teams to help them understand and implement the required IAM changes.

What We Achieved:
The issue was permanently resolved by implementing group-based IAM bindings, ensuring scalability and eliminating recurring project creation failures. This improved governance and reduced future operational overhead.

⸻

2. IP Address Management and Reclamation Process

Situation:
The organization lacked an automated IPAM solution, and IP allocations were being manually tracked through SharePoint, leading to inefficiencies and inconsistent utilization.

My Contribution:
I took ownership of maintaining and updating the manual IP allocation sheet, introduced clear demarcation of IP ranges, and established a process for revoking unused IPs. I collaborated with Cloud Ops and application teams to implement an approval and communication workflow for reclamation.

What We Achieved:
Created a repeatable, auditable IP address management process, improving visibility and freeing up significant unused IP ranges. This initiative laid the foundation for future IPAM automation.

⸻

3. Composer Migration (Composer 2 → Composer 3)

Situation:
The Composer team planned to migrate over 300 environments to Composer 3, initially requesting one dedicated subnet per Composer instance, which risked IP range exhaustion.

My Contribution:
I proposed using a shared subnet model combined with HNAT, explained the design benefits, and helped the team implement and validate the setup.

What We Achieved:
Optimized IP utilization, avoided subnet exhaustion, and provided a scalable model that supported all Composer environments efficiently.

⸻

4. Private Service Connect (PSC) and Vertex AI Networking

Situation:
Teams faced issues setting up PSC for the network prediction service integrated with Vertex AI, including a critical issue where PSC consumer subnets were wrongly flagged due to Terraform apply behavior.

My Contribution:
I analyzed and identified the Terraform-related issue, provided technical guidance to correct the configuration, and shared learnings with the broader team through a brown-bag session.

What We Achieved:
Resolved the PSC configuration issue, improved reliability of PSC deployments, and enhanced team knowledge to prevent similar future incidents.

⸻

5. Knowledge Sharing and Documentation

Situation:
There was limited team awareness around network segmentation concepts and the current network design architecture.

My Contribution:
I conducted brown-bag sessions on PSC troubleshooting, micro and macro segmentation, and created detailed network architecture diagrams. I also contributed to the Prod Discovery setup for the AD-ENT environment.

What We Achieved:
Improved team understanding of network architecture and security segmentation. Enhanced documentation and onboarding resources for ongoing and future projects.
