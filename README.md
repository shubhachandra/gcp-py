Proposed Working Session – Network Diagrams

We need to schedule a working session to create the following:
	•	Topology Diagram
	•	Transit Connectivity Diagram
	•	Unified Diagram (optional)

For the Transit Diagram, we will need Preetam’s assistance, as he has previously demonstrated the cross-region connectivity. Currently, we have us-central1 and us-east1, and upcoming additions include us-south1 and us-east4.

The NCC diagram is already available with Dele.

This session will be scheduled based on the availability of team members from each group.

Tools to be used:
	•	Microsoft Visio (Office 365)
	•	Microsoft PowerPoint
