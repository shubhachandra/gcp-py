Subject: Clarification on IAM Policy Error 400 (Maximum Members Exceeded)

Hi,

We encountered the following issue/error:

Error 400: The number of members in the policy (1501) exceeds the maximum allowed limit (1500), resulting in an invalid IAM policy.

This error occurs because each IAM policy has a limit on the number of principals allowed within its role bindings. Our current setup references these networks multiple times across various modules, potentially hundreds of times. Each project may or may not require all of these network references, which has unintentionally inflated the total number of service accounts needing network access.

To resolve this issue, we have two possible approaches:

Optimize and streamline how we include these network references in each project to reduce the number of required service account permissions.

Request a quota increase from Google to accommodate our current requirements.

Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.

**Subject:** Proposed Plan for Network Range Reduction  

Hi Team,

Here's our plan to reduce the current network size:

Currently, we have the subnet `100.126.128.0/20`. The objective is to delete this subnet and carve out smaller subnets as follows:

- `100.126.128.0/21` for **us-central1**
- `100.126.192.0/21` for **us-east1**

However, there's one DNS entry pointing to an existing IP within this range:

- DNS Entry: `modelarmor.us-central1q.rep.googleapis.com` (A-record pointing to `100.126.128.4`)

Directly deleting this subnet poses a challenge due to the DNS dependency.

**Proposed Solution Steps:**

**Step 1:**  
- Create a temporary, smaller subnet from an available IP range.  
- Update the DNS A-record (`modelarmor.us-central1q.rep.googleapis.com`) to point to the new temporary IP.  
- Plan and apply these changes cautiously, as this step might impact Vertex AI notebooks.

**Step 2:**  
- After the DNS record update, delete the existing large subnets:  
  - `100.126.128.0/20`  
  - `100.123.128.0/20` (assuming this is also intended for cleanup)  
- Carve out the new `/21` subnets as planned above.  
- Update the DNS A-record to point to the permanent IP in the newly created `/21` subnet.  
- Finally, delete the temporary subnet created in Step 1.

Please confirm if this approach aligns with expectations, and let me know how you'd like to proceed.

Thanks,

Update on RFC1918 Address Space and Cloud NAT Implementation
	•	The plan was to use RFC1918 address space, as these IPs are non-routable by design, aligning with our goal of keeping internal services isolated from public exposure.
	•	This approach was agreed upon and also communicated by Richard.

Current Situation:
	•	We are in the process of enabling Cloud NAT, which is required to allow communication from cloud workloads to on-prem environments.
	•	Until Cloud NAT is fully configured and deployed, these workloads cannot reach on-prem resources.

Progress Update:
	•	The PR has been approved.
	•	Testing is already underway in the background, with rigorous validation to ensure every possible scenario is covered.
	•	Our goal is to avoid any future impact by proactively identifying and addressing edge cases during this phase.

Proposed Working Session – Network Diagrams

We need to schedule a working session to create the following:
	•	Topology Diagram
	•	Transit Connectivity Diagram
	•	Unified Diagram (optional)

For the Transit Diagram, we will need Preetam’s assistance, as he has previously demonstrated the cross-region connectivity. Currently, we have us-central1 and us-east1, and upcoming additions include us-south1 and us-east4.

The NCC diagram is already available with Dele.

This session will be scheduled based on the availability of team members from each group.

Tools to be used:
	•	Microsoft Visio (Office 365)
	•	Microsoft PowerPoint
