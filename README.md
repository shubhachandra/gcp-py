Subject: Snippet Code for Adding Members to Group Profile - Completed

Hello all,

The snippet code for adding members to the group profile has been completed.

Steps taken:
	1.	The IAM team created subnetwork groups where the service account will be added.
	2.	The IAM team granted the Terraform service account (from the sandbox provisioning project workspace) the Owner role on the group.
	3.	The Networking team added the group profile with the compute.networkUser role.

Next Steps:
	1.	Integrate the snippet into the project-factory code under the networking.tf file. Please review or approve the changes.
	2.	Create a new beta version.
	3.	Test with a few provisioning projects by removing the shared VPC names.

Expected Result:
The service account will be added as a member of the group, and its access to shared subnets will be removed.
