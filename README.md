Subject: [Important] New Process for Unused Subnet Reclamation – Starting This Sprint

⸻

Hi All,

As part of our network optimization and sustainability efforts, we are implementing a subnet reclamation process starting this sprint. This initiative is critical because IP address ranges are a limited resource, and we are currently experiencing shortages that affect our ability to provision new services and meet ongoing demands.

⸻

What will happen?
	•	From this sprint onward, the Networking and Ops teams will review subnets that have not been used for more than 90 days.
	•	You will receive a separate communication if any such subnets are identified under your projects.
	•	These notifications will include:
	•	Subnet name
	•	Associated SDLC environment
	•	Service project name
	•	Planned deletion timeline

⸻

What you need to do:

✅ Review the subnet details provided in those emails.
✅ If you still need any of these subnets, please respond within 5 business days with a valid justification for retaining them.
✅ If no response is received within that time frame, and no active resources are detected, we will assume the subnet is safe to delete and proceed with reclamation.

⸻

Why are we doing this?
	•	The pool of available IP address ranges is limited and close to exhaustion.
	•	By reclaiming unused subnets, we can free up IP capacity to fulfill current and future project needs, including critical deployments for GKE clusters, Composer, and AI Notebooks.
	•	This process will help maintain a clean, efficient, and sustainable network environment.

We appreciate your support and cooperation to ensure this initiative is successful. Please reach out if you have any questions or would like to discuss this further.

Thank you for working with us to keep our infrastructure healthy and future-ready.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Networking Team
