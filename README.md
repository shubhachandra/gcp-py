Subject: Justification for Unlabeled GKE-Managed Resources

Hi [Recipient/Team],

During recent Prisma scans, we noticed alerts for missing labels on certain Google Cloud resources, such as Cloud DNS managed zones, which are automatically created when a GKE cluster is provisioned.

We want to highlight that these resources are “under-the-hood” components managed by GKE and are not explicitly created or controlled by our Terraform code. Google Kubernetes Engine automatically provisions and manages these objects (e.g., DNS zones, firewall rules, IP addresses) to support cluster operations. Currently, Google Cloud does not provide a native way to apply labels during cluster creation for these dependent resources.

Action taken / Mitigation steps:
	•	We have documented these GKE-managed resources as exceptions to our tagging policy.
	•	Where possible, we are implementing post-provisioning scripts (using gcloud/Terraform null_resource) to add labels after resource creation, but these labels may not always stay in sync with GKE lifecycle changes.
	•	These resources are ephemeral and GKE-owned, and any manual modification may cause drift or unintended issues.

Request:
We propose to treat these specific GKE-managed resources as policy exceptions for labeling requirements and mark them accordingly in Prisma or our compliance dashboards.

Please confirm if you agree with this approach, or let us know if additional documentation is required.

Thanks & Regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Team]

Would you like me to make a shorter version for senior management or a more technical version with Terraform script reference for engineering teams?

Example Provider Block

terraform {
  required_providers {
    bluecat = {
      source  = "bluecatlabs/bluecat"
      version = ">= 0.1.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "bluecat" {
  username    = var.bluecat_username      # Service account or user name
  password    = var.bluecat_password      # Sensitive, keep in Vault or env vars
  server      = var.bluecat_server        # IP or hostname of BAM/Gateway
  port        = 443                       # Typically 443 (HTTPS) or 80 (HTTP)
  transport   = "https"                   # "https" or "http"
  api_version = "v1"                      # Example: "v1" or the version supported by your Gateway
}

Variables File (variables.tf)

variable "bluecat_username" {
  description = "BlueCat service account username"
}

variable "bluecat_password" {
  description = "BlueCat service account password"
  sensitive   = true
}

variable "bluecat_server" {
  description = "BlueCat BAM or Gateway hostname/IP"
}

Passing Values Securely
	•	Environment variables:

export TF_VAR_bluecat_username=svc_terraform
export TF_VAR_bluecat_password='********'
export TF_VAR_bluecat_server='100.120.136.196'


	•	Or store them in Terraform Cloud workspace variables.

Notes
	•	api_version depends on your BlueCat Gateway version. For BAM 9.6+, v1 is usually correct.
	•	Ensure the port you specify matches the Gateway listener (default HTTPS is 443).
	•	transport must match the protocol your Gateway uses (https recommended).

⸻

Do you also want me to add an example resource (like creating a configuration) using this provider block so you can test connectivity? Or show how to switch from username/password to API token (service-account style)?

Here’s the approach:

1. Create a Service Account User in BlueCat
	•	Log in to BlueCat Address Manager (BAM) as an admin.
	•	Go to Administration → Users and Groups → Add User.
	•	Create a new user specifically for Terraform automation (e.g., svc_terraform).
	•	Assign only the necessary permissions (least privilege principle).

2. Generate API Credentials
	•	This user will authenticate via BlueCat Gateway REST API.
	•	Obtain the Gateway URL (e.g., https://<gateway-host>/Services/REST/v1).

3. Store Credentials Securely
	•	Never hardcode credentials in Terraform code.
	•	Use environment variables, Terraform Cloud/Enterprise workspace variables, or Vault. Example:

export BLUECAT_USERNAME=svc_terraform
export BLUECAT_PASSWORD='********'
export BLUECAT_SERVER_URL='https://<gateway-host>'



4. Terraform Provider Configuration

Add the BlueCat provider in your Terraform code. For example:

terraform {
  required_providers {
    bluecat = {
      source  = "bluecatlabs/bluecat"
      version = ">=0.1.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "bluecat" {
  username = var.bluecat_username
  password = var.bluecat_password
  server_url = var.bluecat_server_url
}

5. Using Variables Instead of Hardcoding

Define variables in variables.tf:

variable "bluecat_username" {}
variable "bluecat_password" {
  sensitive = true
}
variable "bluecat_server_url" {}

Pass them via environment variables or a tfvars file.

6. Creating a Configuration Object

Example resource to create a configuration:

resource "bluecat_configuration" "example" {
  name        = "Test_Config"
  description = "Created via Terraform"
}

Notes:
	•	If you want OAuth2/JWT-style tokens, BlueCat Gateway 9.6+ supports API tokens, which can mimic service account behavior. You generate a token once and use it in place of username/password. Let me know if you want the API token method documented.
	•	Ensure your BlueCat Gateway instance is accessible to Terraform execution environment.

Would you like me to give a step-by-step guide for using API tokens (no username/password) so that it works more like a service account? Or detail how to create and manage the dedicated automation user in BlueCat BAM?
