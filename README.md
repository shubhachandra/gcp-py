Here’s a refined and professional version of your follow-up statement and question for clarity and communication with your team:

⸻

This issue arises when using the Dialogflow API, which requires assigning the following two roles at the core host VPC project:
	•	roles/servicedirectory.networkAttacher
	•	roles/servicedirectory.pscAuthorizedService

These roles must be granted via cross-project IAM bindings, which requires Security Admin or Service Account Admin permissions—currently missing from the seed-prod-app service account.

⸻

Questions for Clarification:
	1.	Is there any architectural change regarding Dialogflow usage?
	•	If Dialogflow is still part of the architecture, we need confirmation on where it is currently being used and in which GCP project(s).
	2.	Why was the seed-prod-app service account changed to seed-app in the core environment?
	•	Was this part of a broader standardization or consolidation initiative by the Landing Zone (LZ) team?
	•	Did this change go through architecture/security review, considering the impact on IAM permissions?
