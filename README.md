Subject: Request for Approval – Creation of New IAM Groups to Unblock Non-Prod Deployments

Hi [Recipient’s Name],

We are actively working on unblocking the non-production deployments using the solution provided by Google. As part of this, we have created IAM groups for the following roles:
	•	Subnet Network User
	•	VPC Service Agent
	•	Container Host VPC Role
	•	VPC Access User

Initially, we planned to use the same subnet-level groups with the NetworkUser role for both the subnets and the Host VPC. However, we have now revised the approach to separate the Host VPC and subnet bindings. This requires a new set of groups per SDLC environment to manage permissions at the Host VPC level.

Our deployment solution is ready, and the only blocker at this point is the creation of these new IAM groups. These will be used exclusively at the Host VPC level and will be assigned the Compute NetworkUser role.

We request your approval to proceed with the creation of these groups on priority, along with appropriate owner assignments. An expedited change request (CR) would help us move forward without further delays.

Thank you for your support.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

Let me know if you’d like it shortened or tailored further based on who you’re sending it to.

1. **psc-generic-backend**
2. **psc-generic-endpoints**
3. **psc-publish-custom-service**

Each of these will handle a distinct part of the PSC setup and can be reused individually or composed as needed.

---

### Tasks:

* [x] Review and finalize `psc-publish-onprem-service` as reference
* [ ] Create `psc-generic-backend` with backend service, NEG, health checks, proxy
* [ ] Create `psc-generic-endpoints` with internal IP + forwarding rule
* [ ] Create `psc-publish-custom-service` with `google_compute_service_attachment`
* [ ] Write a Confluence documentation page with explanation and usage examples
* [ ] Peer review and integrate with existing PSC Factory modules

---

### Acceptance Criteria:

* All three modules are independently deployable and reusable
* Variable inputs and outputs are documented clearly
* Module dependencies are decoupled and composable
* Confluence page includes explanation, diagrams, and code examples
* Modules tested in sandbox environment with sample deployment

---

## 🧾 Confluence Page (Draft)

**Title**: Google Cloud PSC Terraform Submodules

**Parent Page**: Infrastructure → GCP Platform Modules → Private Service Connect

---

### Overview

To modularize and scale our Private Service Connect (PSC) setup on GCP, we've created 4 Terraform submodules. These support use cases for publishing on-prem, internal, or partner services using Google's PSC infrastructure.

---

### 📦 Submodules

#### 1. ✅ `psc-publish-onprem-service` (Reference Module)

**Purpose**: Full stack PSC publishing module for on-prem services
**Includes**:

* PSC NAT subnet
* NEG and Health Checks
* Backend Service and Target TCP Proxy
* ILB Forwarding Rule
* Service Attachment

**Usage**: End-to-end ready PSC setup for publishing private IP endpoints hosted on-prem.

---

#### 2. 🛠️ `psc-generic-backend` *(To Be Developed)*

**Purpose**: Provision backend infrastructure required for PSC publishing

**Includes**:

* `google_compute_region_network_endpoint_group` (NON\_GCP\_PRIVATE\_IP\_PORT)
* `google_compute_region_backend_service`
* `google_compute_region_health_check`
* `google_compute_region_target_tcp_proxy`

**Input**:

* `endpoints` (map of IPs + ports)
* `health_check` settings
* `project_id`, `region`, `tenant`, `environment`

**Output**:

* NEG and backend service name

**Use Case**: Used when backend service and traffic routing infra are needed but not IP or service attachment.

---

#### 3. 🛠️ `psc-generic-endpoints` *(To Be Developed)*

**Purpose**: Create an internal IP and forwarding rule for exposing a backend via PSC

**Includes**:

* `google_compute_address`
* `google_compute_forwarding_rule`

**Input**:

* `target`: backend service or proxy
* `port_range`, `ip_protocol`
* `network_self_link`, `subnetwork`

**Output**:

* Internal IP
* Forwarding rule name

**Use Case**: Used to bind existing backend to an internal PSC-ready IP.

---

#### 4. 🛠️ `psc-publish-custom-service` *(To Be Developed)*

**Purpose**: Attach an existing forwarding rule or target service via PSC

**Includes**:

* `google_compute_service_attachment`

**Input**:

* `target_service`
* `psc_nat_subnets`
* `connection_preference`, `consumer_accept_lists`

**Output**:

* Service attachment URL

**Use Case**: Use when backend infra already exists and you only need to expose it via PSC.

### ✅ Next Steps

* Implement and validate each submodule in `lab` environment
* Update this page with outputs and versioning
* Add module examples to `wf-private-service-connect-factory`

Would you like me to generate the **`README.md` files** for each module next, including input/output tables and usage examples?
