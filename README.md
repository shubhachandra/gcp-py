**Revised Version:**

We are facing an issue: the Non-Prod Host project has already reached the member binding limit of 2500, so no new members can be added. We attempted to add 4 new groups as members, but it failed with the same error — **“policy size is too large.”**

This impacts the Project Factory CR process. Here’s the proposed approach:

**Option 1:**

1. Release and announce the new version (v2) of the Project Factory.
2. Migrate 20 projects to this new version. This will help free up IAM policy space in the current host project.
3. Once some space is available, apply this CR to add the 4 new groups.

**Option 2:**

* Identify and delete unused/non-critical projects to free up policy space.
* Apply the change to add the 4 new groups.
* Then proceed with the migration to the new version.

We recommend aligning the CR application **immediately after** project migration to avoid conflicts.
