Here’s the Jira change description template filled out based on your Palo Alto network implementation in GCP and your provisioning repo:

Change Description

1. Description:
This change provisions a new GCP folder and two service projects to support the implementation of Palo Alto firewall VMs. The service projects will be attached to an existing core host project as Shared VPC service projects. Multiple core subnets will be shared with these new service projects. The provisioning is handled via an automated Terraform-based project provisioning repository.

2. Change Justification:
This setup is required to deploy Palo Alto VM-Series firewalls in a dedicated, isolated environment while still maintaining connectivity with the core network via Shared VPC. Creating separate service projects ensures modular deployment, least privilege access control, and operational separation.

3. Benefits and Impact if Not Implemented:
	•	Benefits:
	•	Enables secure and scalable firewall deployment
	•	Supports centralized firewalling with distributed service projects
	•	Ensures adherence to network segmentation and compliance requirements
	•	Impact if Not Implemented:
	•	Delays Palo Alto firewall deployment in GCP
	•	Security posture may remain weak due to lack of centralized firewall
	•	Inability to route traffic through required inspection points

4. Known Defects and Sign-off:
No known defects in the provisioning code. The Terraform code has been peer-reviewed and tested in a lower environment.

5. Alerting and Monitoring Adjustments:
No immediate monitoring changes as this phase involves project and subnet provisioning only. Alerts and logs related to firewall VMs will be configured in subsequent phases.

6. Blast Radius if Change Fails:
	•	Scope is limited to a new folder and two new service projects.
	•	Shared VPC host project may experience IAM binding or subnet-sharing issues if the change misconfigures roles.
	•	No existing production resources are directly impacted.

7. Post-change Validation & Checkout Plan:
	•	Validate the creation of the folder and both service projects
	•	Confirm the service projects are attached to the Shared VPC host
	•	Ensure intended subnets are correctly shared
	•	Verify IAM roles are assigned properly for deployment and network access
	•	Run a dry-run of Palo Alto provisioning to confirm pre-requisites

8. Communications to Business, Operations, and Command Centers:
	•	Email summary and Slack notification will be sent post-deployment
	•	Documented in weekly status update to Network Engineering team
	•	No customer-facing communication required for this backend setup

9. High-level Implementation Steps:
	1.	Trigger Terraform pipeline from provisioning repo
	2.	Create folder under specified parent
	3.	Create two service projects under the new folder
	4.	Attach each project to the Shared VPC host
	5.	Share required subnets with each service project
	6.	Apply IAM bindings
	7.	Perform validation steps

10. Backout Plan (Non-technical):
	•	Manually delete the service projects and folder via gcloud or GCP Console
	•	Remove any VPC attachments or IAM bindings
	•	Terraform state will be preserved for cleanup
	•	Reference: Backout steps in provisioning repo under docs/backout.md

11. Rollback Limitations:
	•	Once projects are created, they cannot be renamed (only deleted)
	•	IAM bindings can be reverted
	•	Subnet sharing can be removed
	•	No irreversible changes expected in this phase

12. Fail-forward Deployment:
No, this is not a fail-forward deployment. Full rollback is possible by removing the created resources.

Let me know if you’d like me to include project names, folder ID, or subnet ranges — I can refine this further for submission.
