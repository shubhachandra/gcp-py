Here’s your weekly update for Shubhachandra pulled together cleanly:

⸻

Weekly Update – Shubhachandra

Prod Discovery
	•	Completed from networking side: VPC, Subnets, Firewalls, VPC-SC, and Seed Account Creation.
	•	Logging Project creation pending → must keep feature open since it’s tied to logging.

⸻

BlueCat
	•	Discovered that Cloud Discovery Tool (additional purchase) is required for direct GCP integration.
	•	Exploring Terraform integration with BlueCat.
	•	Proposal raised with Niguel to purchase the tool along with BlueCat base license.
	•	SSH issue: unable to log in to upload license; in touch with Richard for resolution.

⸻

Observability
	1.	Quota Alerts
	•	Raised with Louis to set up actionable alerts when quota usage hits 90%, instead of reacting after failures (as happened in sandbox).
	2.	Metrics Identification
	•	Sai & Hemalatha are working on listing and filtering important networking metrics to be captured for dashboards.

Do you want me to also merge this with the longer “Shubh’s update” you gave earlier today, so the weekly report covers both streams (Shubhachandra + Shubh) together in one consolidated format?
