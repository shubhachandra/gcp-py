Understood. Here's a refined, **professional version** of the PoC document for **Confluence**, with no mention of HSBC and a clean layout. This version includes **actionable checkpoints** and excludes any direct references to specific organizations or banks.

# **Proof of Concept â€“ BlueCat IPAM Implementation on GCP Sandbox**

---

## **1. Purpose**

This PoC is intended to evaluate the feasibility of deploying and utilizing **BlueCat IP Address Management (IPAM)** on the **GCP QA-ent sandbox environment**. The goal is to modernize IP address management across multiple SDLC stages by eliminating manual spreadsheets, reducing conflicts, and streamlining change request workflows.

## **2. Current Landscape & Challenges**

### **Environment Overview**

| Environment | SDLC Stages                                    | Approximate Subnet Count |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| QA-ent      | prod, nonprod, sandbox, pdisco, PAA, PCI, core | 100+ subnets per SDLC    |
| AD-ent      | prod, nonprod, sandbox, pdisco, PAA, PCI, core | 100+ subnets per SDLC    |

### **Key Challenges**

* Manual Excel-based tracking leads to **IP conflicts**
* Delayed **Change Request (CR)** approvals and provisioning
* Lack of real-time visibility and **audit trails**
* Increasing operational complexity and risk

## **3. Why BlueCat?**

| Capability                   | Benefit                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Centralized IP Management    | Unified platform across all SDLC stages and environments    |
| Real-Time Conflict Detection | Prevent overlapping allocations at the source               |
| Role-Based Access Control    | Granular access and governance across teams                 |
| API & Automation Ready       | Enables integration with CI/CD and infrastructure workflows |
| Full Auditability            | Tracks changes, ownership, and usage history                |
