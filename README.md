**Subject:** Confirmation on Next Steps for C2T Prod Subnet Request

**Hi Shwet,**

Thanks — the subnets have been reserved for the C2T applications in Prod, and I’ve raised the PR accordingly.

Could you please confirm if the Ops team will take it forward from here? Or does Deepak need to coordinate with them regarding the intake request (which I believe is already in place)?

Also, can you confirm if the Ops team will assist with creating the CR, merging, and applying the changes? For approvals, the Network team will continue to provide support as needed.

Thanks & Regards,
\[Your Name]
