That's exactly how Private Service Connect (PSC) is designed to work. You were unable to create an endpoint in the "reserved" subnet because that subnet has a specific and exclusive purpose for the **service producer**.

---

### The Two Types of PSC Subnets

There are two distinct types of subnets involved in a PSC connection, each serving a different role:

1.  **Consumer Subnet (No Quote):** This is a regular VPC subnet in your project, which acts as the **service consumer**. You can deploy your VMs and other resources in this subnet. When you create a PSC endpoint (a forwarding rule), it reserves an internal IP address from this very subnet. Your applications then use this IP to send traffic to the external service. This is why you were able to successfully create the PSC endpoint here.

2.  **PSC Service Producer Subnet (with the quote):** This is a special-purpose subnet created by the **service producer** (the organization or team offering the service). It has the `--purpose=PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT` flag. The quote ‚Äúthis is a subnet reserved for Private Service Connect service‚Äù is GCP's way of telling you that this subnet isn't for your resources. Its sole purpose is for the producer's network to perform **Source NAT** on the traffic coming from your PSC endpoint. You cannot create any resources, including IP reservations or endpoints, directly within this subnet. It is part of the producer's infrastructure, not yours.

In short, your observation is a correct and expected behavior. You create the **endpoint** (the "front door" for your applications) in a **standard consumer subnet** and connect it to a **service attachment** which uses the special **producer subnet** behind the scenes. The "invalid" error you received is GCP's way of enforcing this architectural separation, preventing you from using a producer subnet for consumer-side resources.

**Subject:** Clarification on Deboarding the Cab Midway

Dear \[Transport Team/Manager],

This is in response to your request for clarification on why I had to deboard the cab midway today.

The reason was the **extremely congested seating arrangement** in the allocated sedan. With four employees plus the driver, the back seat was overcrowded with three people squeezed in, making the 2-hour journey physically unbearable and unsafe. Despite raising this concern earlier as well, the arrangement continues unchanged.

Due to severe discomfort and pain, I had no option but to deboard midway. Continuing in that condition would have risked my health and safety. I believe such an arrangement does not align with **Wells Fargo‚Äôs safety and wellness standards**.

I request that future travel arrangements take into account both safety and comfort ‚Äî for example, using a larger vehicle when four employees are scheduled. This will help avoid such situations and ensure compliance with employee well-being standards.

Regards,
\[Your Name]

Do you want me to make this reply **more defensive (justifying your action)** or **more solution-focused (emphasizing what should change going forward)**?
Good question üëç Let‚Äôs connect VPC-SC to macro-segmentation:

‚∏ª

How VPC-SC Helps in Macro-Segmentation

‚úÖ Perimeter Boundaries = Macro Segments
	‚Ä¢	Each VPC-SC perimeter acts as a logical segment for an SDLC (Dev, QA, Prod, etc.).
	‚Ä¢	This separates environments at the folder/project level.

‚úÖ Isolation Across Environments
	‚Ä¢	Traffic between perimeters is blocked by default.
	‚Ä¢	Prevents accidental or malicious data movement between Dev ‚Üî QA ‚Üî Prod.

‚úÖ Shared VPC Within Segment
	‚Ä¢	Within a perimeter, projects (host + service projects) can communicate via Shared VPC.
	‚Ä¢	Ensures collaboration within a segment while keeping strict boundaries outside.

‚úÖ Controlled Exceptions (Ingress/Egress Policies)
	‚Ä¢	If cross-environment communication is required, it‚Äôs done via explicit policies.
	‚Ä¢	Acts like firewall rules at the service boundary.

‚úÖ Macro Segmentation Layered with Network Segmentation
	‚Ä¢	Network-level segmentation (VPC, subnet, firewall rules) + VPC-SC (service perimeter) = defense-in-depth.
	‚Ä¢	Macro: Isolate whole environments (SDLC level).
	‚Ä¢	Micro: Control at subnet / workload level inside the environment.

‚∏ª

üëâ In short:
VPC-SC gives you macro-segmentation by isolating environments and controlling data movement at the service/API level, while traditional VPC/subnet design + IAM handles micro-segmentation.

‚∏ª

Do you want me to convert this into PowerPoint-style points (slide-ready) like I did earlier, so you can directly use it in your deck?

‚úÖ Restricts service-to-service data movement ‚Äì Blocks unapproved API calls across environments (e.g., Dev ‚Üí Prod).

‚úÖ Egress rules control ‚Äì Define exactly what outbound traffic between environments is allowed.

‚úÖ Ingress rules for trusted services ‚Äì Only allow traffic from approved environments (e.g., QA ‚Üí Prod, but not Dev).

‚úÖ Hybrid & multi-cloud protection ‚Äì Treats external traffic as untrusted unless explicitly authorized.

‚úÖ Auditing & visibility ‚Äì Logs all cross-perimeter attempts with reason codes like PERIMETER_VIOLATION.

‚úÖ Context-aware access ‚Äì Enforces rules based on identity, device, and network location for finer control.

‚∏ª

Do you also want me to create a one-slide diagram with these points mapped to Dev‚ÄìQA‚ÄìProd environments so it‚Äôs presentation-ready?

How VPC Service Controls (VPC-SC) Helps with Cross-Environment Traffic

VPC Service Controls (VPC-SC) is a data exfiltration protection framework in Google Cloud. It doesn‚Äôt control east-west routing like a traditional VPC firewall; instead, it enforces context-aware access and service perimeters around Google-managed services (like BigQuery, Cloud Storage, Pub/Sub, etc.).

When you say cross-environment traffic, this usually means:
	‚Ä¢	Different environments like Dev, QA, Prod
	‚Ä¢	Different projects in the same or different folders
	‚Ä¢	Hybrid setups (on-prem ‚Üî GCP, or multi-cloud)
	‚Ä¢	Cross-region data movement

Here‚Äôs how VPC-SC helps:

‚∏ª

1. Restricts Service-to-Service Data Movement
	‚Ä¢	By default, without VPC-SC, a workload in Dev could call APIs in Prod (e.g., a Cloud Function in Dev writing into a Prod BigQuery dataset).
	‚Ä¢	With VPC-SC, if Dev and Prod are in different perimeters, such calls are blocked unless explicitly allowed (via ingress/egress rules).
‚úÖ Prevents accidental or malicious data movement across environments.

‚∏ª

2. Egress Rules Control
	‚Ä¢	You can define what cross-environment traffic is allowed.
For example:
	‚Ä¢	Allow QA ‚Üí Prod BigQuery only for a specific service account.
	‚Ä¢	Block Dev from accessing Prod Cloud Storage buckets.
‚úÖ Gives fine-grained control over data flow across environments.

‚∏ª

3. Ingress Rules for Trusted Services
	‚Ä¢	Allows only traffic from trusted environments into sensitive perimeters.
Example:
	‚Ä¢	Prod perimeter allows only ingress from the QA perimeter, not from Dev.
‚úÖ Ensures only approved environments can exchange data.

‚∏ª

4. Hybrid & Multi-Cloud Protection
	‚Ä¢	If traffic originates outside GCP (on-prem, another cloud, or the public internet), VPC-SC treats it as ‚Äúoutside perimeter‚Äù unless you configure an access level.
‚úÖ Prevents workloads from leaking sensitive data to untrusted external locations.

‚∏ª

5. Auditing & Visibility
	‚Ä¢	All cross-perimeter attempts are logged in Cloud Audit Logs with reason codes (e.g., PERIMETER_VIOLATION).
‚úÖ Helps detect misconfigurations or unauthorized data flows across environments.

‚∏ª

6. Context-Aware Access
	‚Ä¢	You can enforce rules based on:
	‚Ä¢	Identity (user, service account)
	‚Ä¢	Device security (corporate laptop vs unknown device)
	‚Ä¢	Network location (on-prem IP vs external IP)
‚úÖ So cross-environment traffic is allowed only if the context matches security policies.

‚∏ª

üîë In short:
VPC-SC provides a virtual fence around GCP services, ensuring data cannot silently flow between Dev/QA/Prod environments, regions, or external networks without explicit policy. It makes cross-environment traffic visible, auditable, and controlled instead of open by default.

‚∏ª

üëâ Do you want me to make a diagram showing how Dev, QA, and Prod traffic is blocked/allowed with VPC-SC? That might make it more visual.
