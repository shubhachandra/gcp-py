# This block of IAM bindings assigns the necessary roles to user groups for proper networking and service access:
# 1. Grants 'roles/compute.networkUser' on specific subnets to allow VM interface creation.
# 2. Grants 'roles/compute.networkUser' at the Shared VPC host project level for broader network access.
# 3. Grants 'roles/composer.sharedVpcAgent' at the host project level to enable Cloud Composer to use the Shared VPC.
# 4. Grants 'roles/vpcaccess.user' at the host project level to allow usage of Serverless VPC Access connectors.
# 5. Grants 'roles/container.hostServiceAgentUser' at the host project level to allow GKE to use host project services.
	‚Ä¢	Why it‚Äôs useful: Detect privilege escalations or unauthorized access.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Required for security auditing.

üß† Final Tip: Use Cloud Monitoring Dashboards and Log-Based Metrics
	‚Ä¢	Create custom dashboards for:
	‚Ä¢	App success/failure
	‚Ä¢	Load balancer latency
	‚Ä¢	DNS lookup failures
	‚Ä¢	Backend error rates
	‚Ä¢	Create alerts using log-based metrics (e.g., firewall deny, DNS errors, 5xx errors)

Let me know your GCP architecture (VMs, GKE, Interconnect, etc.) and I can give a checklist tailored specifically to that.
