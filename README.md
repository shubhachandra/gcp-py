Subject: Request to Increase IAM Policy Quota

Hi Team,

Each IAM allow policy can contain up to 1,500 principals. For the purpose of this limit, IAM counts all instances of each principal in the allow policy role bindings — including repeated references.

In our current setup, any new project created using Terraform results in a failure because:
	•	Our configuration references shared VPC networks each time.
	•	A new service account is added as a principal that requires access.
	•	We’re approaching or have exceeded the 1,500 principal limit.

Given these constraints, we are unable to proceed with new project provisioning. We request an increase in the IAM policy quota to accommodate our setup.

Please let us know the next steps or if any additional information is required.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
