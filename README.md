Here‚Äôs how you can structure your solution, documentation, and Jira tickets based on your constraints and requirements:

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Summary of Requirements
	1.	Add a service account to a Google Workspace (Cloud Identity) group
	2.	Later allow adding group profiles to Google Workspace groups
	3.	No direct use of resource blocks in Terraform due to compliance policies
	4.	Create a module for assigning group profiles to google_compute_subnetwork_iam_member
	5.	Provide complete README with input variables and supported versions
	6.	Create 2 Jira tickets:
	‚Ä¢	Ticket 1: Add service account to a group
	‚Ä¢	Ticket 2: Grant subnet IAM access to a group profile

# Google Cloud Group Membership Module

This module adds a service account to a Google Workspace (Cloud Identity) group. The module is intended for use in environments where direct `resource` blocks are not allowed.

## Usage

```hcl
module "group_membership" {
  source                    = "./gcp-group-membership"
  google_workspace_credentials = file("admin-creds.json")
  customer_id              = "C0xxxxxx"
  group_email              = "example-group@yourdomain.com"
  service_account_email    = "service-account@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
}

Inputs

Name	Description	Type	Required
google_workspace_credentials	Path to Google Workspace admin SDK credentials JSON	string	‚úÖ Yes
customer_id	Google Workspace customer ID	string	‚úÖ Yes
group_email	Email of the target Google group	string	‚úÖ Yes
service_account_email	Service account email to be added	string	‚úÖ Yes

Versioning
	‚Ä¢	Terraform >= 1.3
	‚Ä¢	Google Workspace Provider >= 0.8.0

Note: This uses the terraform-google-modules/group module under the hood to avoid direct resource usage.

---

## üõ† Module 2: `gcp-subnet-iam-member-for-group`

To bind a Google group to a subnet IAM role.

```hcl
# main.tf
resource "google_compute_subnetwork_iam_member" "group_binding" {
  subnetwork = var.subnetwork
  region     = var.region
  role       = var.role
  member     = "group:${var.group_email}"
}

variables.tf

variable "subnetwork" {
  description = "Subnetwork name"
  type        = string
}

variable "region" {
  description = "Region of the subnetwork"
  type        = string
}

variable "role" {
  description = "IAM role to assign"
  type        = string
  default     = "roles/compute.networkUser"
}

variable "group_email" {
  description = "Google group email to assign permissions to"
  type        = string
}

üìù Jira Tickets

Jira Ticket 1: Add Service Account to Google Cloud Group

Title: Add Service Account to Google Cloud Group Using Terraform Module

Description:
Develop a Terraform module that uses the terraform-google-modules/group module to add a service account to a Google Workspace group. Compliance constraints restrict use of resource blocks. Ensure the group email and service account email are passed as variables.

Acceptance Criteria:
	‚Ä¢	A reusable module created
	‚Ä¢	README and usage examples provided
	‚Ä¢	No use of native Terraform resource blocks
	‚Ä¢	Inputs: group_email, service_account_email
	‚Ä¢	Uses Google Workspace Admin SDK provider

Jira Ticket 2: Add Group Profile as IAM Member to Subnet

Title: Add Google Group Profile to Subnetwork IAM using Terraform

Description:
Develop a Terraform module to grant a Google Cloud group IAM access to a subnetwork. The module should allow users to bind a group_email to roles like roles/compute.networkUser.

Acceptance Criteria:
	‚Ä¢	Module supports variable inputs for subnetwork, region, role, and group_email
	‚Ä¢	IAM role is added to the subnet for the group
	‚Ä¢	README included with inputs, usage, and versions
	‚Ä¢	Compliant with internal infra policies
