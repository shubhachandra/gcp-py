I need your kind attention on a priority basis.

The Terraform service account currently being used does not have the necessary permissions to add members to the following group. I have attempted this action in both the Networking Workspace and the Project Provisioning Workspace, but encountered the same error in both cases (please refer to the attached screenshot).

Here are the relevant TFE links for reference:

We believe the service account needs permission to manage the group profile in order to add members successfully. Kindly help us verify the group ID and grant the required permissions to the service account.

Your prompt support is appreciated.
