**Subject:** Confirmation on Next Steps for C2T Prod Subnet Request

**Hi Shwet,**

Thanks ‚Äî the subnets have been reserved for the C2T applications in Prod, and I‚Äôve raised the PR accordingly.

Could you please confirm if the Ops team will take it forward from here? Or does Deepak need to coordinate with them regarding the intake request (which I believe is already in place)?

Also, can you confirm if the Ops team will assist with creating the CR, merging, and applying the changes? For approvals, the Network team will continue to provide support as needed.

Thanks & Regards,
\[Your Name]

Sure! Here are **concise answers** to your 3 questions, with the **subnet creation process** per SDLC environment included:

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Why reclaim even small subnets?**

They consume IP space, count toward GCP quotas, clutter config, and block reuse. Small or large ‚Äî if unused, they impact efficiency.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **When can subnets be requested again?**

Anytime, as needed. The request process remains open. Subnets will be reprovisioned based on intake and standard approval.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Impact of keeping unused subnets?**

Blocks IP reuse, wastes quota, increases risk, and adds unnecessary Terraform/config complexity.
