Would you like me to now **combine Preetham, Sai, Hema, and Shubh into one clean weekly status report (ready-to-send)**, or keep them as individual updates for your tracking?

‚úÖ This way, each member‚Äôs contribution is clearly tracked with dependencies, blockers, and progress.

Do you want me to **merge this into a single email draft** (to send as weekly status) or keep it in this structured note format?
