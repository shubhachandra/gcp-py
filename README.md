Of course — here’s a revised version with **“take ownership”** instead of *“assignment”*:

**Subject:** Recurring Review: IP Range Sheet Updates & Ownership

**Objective:**

* Ensure sufficient and conflict-free IP ranges are maintained across all SDLC Excel sheets (routable, non-routable, and PUPI ranges).
* Confirm the updated ranges are regularly reviewed and kept current to avoid shortages.
* Hemalatha and SaiKiran to take ownership: Hema will update the sheets, Sai will cross-verify (or vice versa based on availability).
* Request to send a screenshot-based status email every two weeks as evidence of updates.
* Purpose of this recurring meeting is to prevent escalations, particularly from the US team, by ensuring Ops has reliable, up-to-date IP range data and does not need to escalate due to insufficient ranges.
