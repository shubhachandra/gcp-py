Here’s a clearer and more professional version of your paragraph:

⸻

Objective of the Diagram:
	•	Illustrate the overall network connectivity.
	•	Highlight the use of core networking components like NCC (Network Connectivity Center) and hybrid NAT.
	•	Depict the various SDLC environments, their associated VPCs, subnets, and firewall rules.
	•	Showcase the implementation of hierarchical firewall policies.
	•	Represent regional connectivity, including 100Gb and 10Gb links, and indicate whether MACsec is enabled.
	•	Include connectivity to Wells data centers in Chicago, Dallas, and Ashburn, along with bandwidth details and MACsec status.

⸻

Feedback:
	•	The overall layout looks good.
	•	We can improve clarity by:
	•	Using different colored lines to distinguish 100Gb and 10Gb connections, and indicate MACsec-enabled links.
	•	Clearly marking the use of Cloud Router with NCC NAT.
	•	Highlighting hierarchical firewall rules.
	•	It would be helpful to include smaller focused diagrams for:
	•	NCC with NAT
	•	Hierarchical firewall architecture
	•	MACsec and interconnect details
