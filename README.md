### **Title: GCP Network Architecture: A Deep Dive into Macro & Micro-Segmentation**

**1. Introduction: Our Environment at a Glance**

* **Who We Are:** `ad-ent` and `qa-ent` tenants with domains `wf.com` and `msgqa.wf.com`.
* **Our Landscape:** Multiple SDLCs (Prod, Core, Nonprod, Sandbox, etc.) across key regions (`us-central1`, `us-east1`, `us-south1`, `us-east4`).
* **The Foundation:** Each SDLC has a **host project** with a **Shared VPC**, where app teams connect their **service projects**.
* **Our Goal:** To demonstrate how our network design ensures secure, segmented, and scalable environments.

**2. Macro-Segmentation: The Big Picture**

This is about creating broad, logical boundaries to isolate different environments. We achieve this through:

* **Folder and Project Structure:**
    * Our folder hierarchy mirrors our SDLCs (`/ad-ent/prod`, `/ad-ent/qa`).
    * All host and service projects are named and placed within their respective SDLC folders.
    * **Benefit:** Provides a clear, top-level separation, preventing accidental cross-environment access.
* **VPC Service Controls (VPC-SC):**
    * We have a dedicated **VPC-SC perimeter for each SDLC**. 
    * The **host project and its service projects are all within the same perimeter**.
    * **Benefit:** This creates a **data perimeter**, a hard security boundary that prevents unauthorized data exfiltration and API calls between different SDLCs, even with correct IAM permissions.
* **Network Connectivity Center (Hub and Spoke):**
    * The **Core project acts as a hub**, and other SDLCs are **spokes**.
    * **Benefit:** Centralizes network management and provides a single point for on-premise connectivity, simplifying our routing model.
* **Physical Separation (Dedicated Interconnects):**
    * Each SDLC has dedicated Interconnect VLANs connected to on-premise.
    * **Prod & Core:** 100G links for high-throughput traffic.
    * **Nonprod & Sandbox:** 10G links.
    * **Benefit:** Ensures that traffic from different environments is physically and logically separate, with **MACsec encryption** providing an additional layer of security.

**3. Micro-Segmentation: Security at the Workload Level**

This is about creating fine-grained security policies within our macro-segmented environments.

* **Hierarchical Firewall Policies:**
    * We use **Hierarchical Firewall Policies** at the folder level.
    * These policies define a baseline of allowed/denied traffic that is **inherited by all projects** within that SDLC.
    * **Benefit:** Ensures consistency and compliance across all projects in an environment, acting as our first line of network defense.
* **Shared Subnet Model:**
    * We are moving from dedicated subnets (which led to IP sprawl) to a **shared subnet model**.
    * This is enabled by **Hybrid NAT (H-NAT)**, which allows non-routable workloads to communicate with on-premise services.
    * **How it works for Workloads:** Workloads like **Dataproc, Dataflow, and Composer 3** can share the same subnet. Their security is not based on network separation but on their **service account identity**. 
    * **Benefit:** This is the core of our micro-segmentation strategy. We use **VPC firewall rules tied to specific service accounts** to control communication, meaning one application's workload can't talk to another's, even if they're in the same subnet.
* **Private Service Connect (PSC):**
    * We use **PSC for private connectivity** to cloud services (Cloud SQL, Dialogflow) from on-premise.
    * **Benefit:** Enables our on-premise network to access cloud services using private IPs, bypassing public internet exposure and enhancing security.

**4. The Routing & Security Model in Action: A Deeper Look**

* **Dynamic Routing (BGP) with Custom Advertisement:**
    * We use BGP to exchange routes between GCP and on-premise.
    * Crucially, we use **custom route advertisement** instead of default propagation.
    * **Benefit:** Gives us **granular control** over which routes are advertised, preventing the propagation of sensitive or unwanted routes and improving our security posture.
* **The "Hairpin" Routing Strategy:**
    * Traffic between **nonprod VPCs** is **not directly routed**.
    * Instead, traffic from one nonprod VPC must go to the **on-premise network via the Interconnect** and then return to its destination VPC. 
    * **Benefit:** This "hairpin" model forces all inter-VPC nonprod traffic through our on-premise firewalls, providing a **centralized security checkpoint** and an additional layer of micro-segmentation. This ensures every communication path is explicitly filtered and controlled.

**5. Summary: Our Key Benefits**

* **Macro-Segmentation:** Provides high-level isolation and a strong security perimeter around each SDLC.
* **Micro-Segmentation:** Ensures fine-grained security at the workload level, even within shared networks, protecting against lateral movement.
* **IP Efficiency:** The shared subnet model and T-shirt sizing reduce IP address sprawl and waste.
* **Centralized Control:** Hierarchical firewalls and network connectivity center simplify management and ensure consistent policy enforcement.
* **Enhanced Security:** MACsec encryption, VPC Service Controls, and the hairpin routing model provide a multi-layered, defense-in-depth approach to security.
