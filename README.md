Subject: Cloud Resource Usage & Best Practices Questionnaire

Dear Team,

As part of our efforts to optimize cloud resource allocation and ensure best practices, we request your input on the resources you use, workload sizes, and recommendations for worker nodes. Your responses will help us fine-tune configurations, enhance cost efficiency, and align with best practices.

Please take a few minutes to complete the following questionnaire:

| **Resource**                           | **Used? (Yes/No)** | **Details/Explanation**                                                  | **Best Practices (Optional - Text or Link)** | **Recommended Worker Size (Provide Your Own Suggestion Based on Experience or Google Documentation)** |
