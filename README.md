Nice — here’s a practical, step-by-step guide to take a certificate that was **requested & approved in Venafi** and import it into **BlueCat Secure Access (Address Manager / Gateway)**. I’ll cover what to download from Venafi, which file extensions/formats BlueCat expects, the OpenSSL commands you’ll likely need, and the exact UI clicks inside BlueCat. I’ve also added quick verification and troubleshooting tips.

---

# 1) Quick summary / recommended outcome

* Best file set to prepare for BlueCat Address Manager Secure Access:

  * `domain.crt` — the signed server certificate in **PEM** (`.crt` or `.pem`).
  * `domain.key` — the **private key in PKCS#8 PEM** format (unencrypted if you will install to Gateway; Address Manager can accept an encrypted key + password).
  * `ca-bundle.pem` (or `.ca-bundle`) — PEM file containing the intermediate(s) **and** root CA needed to validate the server cert.
* Alternate single-file export from Venafi: a **PKCS#12** container (`.pfx` / `.p12`) (contains cert + key + chain). You can convert that to the three files above with `openssl`. ([docs.venafi.com][1])

---

# 2) Download the approved certificate from Venafi

(Do this first — choose export format that includes the private key.)

1. Log in to your Venafi Trust Protection Platform / TPP console and open the certificate object (the one that shows “Approved/Issued”).
2. Use **Download** (or Certificate → Download / History → Download) and pick one of these:

   * **Extract PEM contents into separate files** → gives you `certificate.crt`, optional `private.key`, and chain files in a ZIP (recommended — produces PEM files directly).
   * **PKCS#12 / PFX (.pfx / .p12)** → single file containing cert + private key + chain (useful if Venafi only offers PFX). When exporting PFX you’ll be asked to set an export password — keep it safe. ([docs.venafi.com][2])

⚠️ If Venafi is configured to **prevent private-key export**, you must either (a) request a policy change or (b) provision the certificate by a device/endpoint where the CSR was generated (or use Venafi driver to push the cert). Venafi’s UI shows whether a private key is downloadable. ([docs.venafi.com][2])

---

# 3) Convert/prepare files (OpenSSL recipes)

If you downloaded PEM files from Venafi you may already be done. If you downloaded a `.pfx`, use these commands on a workstation with `openssl`.

**(A) From PFX → PEM files (cert, key, chain):**

```bash
# Extract private key (may prompt for the PFX password)
openssl pkcs12 -in cert.pfx -nocerts -nodes -out key.pem

# Extract certificate (leaf)
openssl pkcs12 -in cert.pfx -clcerts -nokeys -out cert.pem

# Extract CA chain (intermediates + root)
openssl pkcs12 -in cert.pfx -cacerts -nokeys -out chain.pem
```

**(B) Convert private key to PKCS#8 (BlueCat Address Manager requires PKCS#8):**

```bash
# Produce an unencrypted PKCS#8 PEM key
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform PEM -nocrypt -in key.pem -out domain.key
```

**(C) If Gateway requires an unencrypted key (Gateway UI does not accept passphrase):**

* If the key is encrypted, remove passphrase (RSA example):

```bash
openssl rsa -in key.pem -out key_nopass.pem   # RSA only
# then convert to PKCS#8 if needed:
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform PEM -nocrypt -in key_nopass.pem -out domain.key
```

(If your key is ECDSA, use the appropriate `openssl ec` commands — the `pkcs8` conversion above still works for converting to PKCS#8.) ([Stack Overflow][3])

**(D) Make the CA bundle file expected by BlueCat:**

* Concatenate intermediates then root into one file:

```bash
# order: intermediate(s) first, then the root certificate
cat intermediate1.pem intermediate2.pem root.pem > ca-bundle.pem
```

---

# 4) Confirm files & basic verification

Run these checks before upload:

* Check certificate and key match (RSA example):

```bash
openssl x509 -noout -modulus -in cert.pem | openssl md5
openssl rsa -noout -modulus -in domain.key | openssl md5
# both should produce identical output
```

(If key is non-RSA, modulus commands differ; check public key or use `openssl pkey`-based checks.)

* Verify chain:

```bash
openssl verify -CAfile ca-bundle.pem cert.pem
```

If these checks fail, re-export or re-convert the files. ([Stack Overflow][3])

# 5) Import into BlueCat Secure Access (Address Manager UI) — step by step

These exact UI labels are from BlueCat docs (Address Manager → Secure Access):

1. Log in to **Address Manager** web UI as admin.
2. Go to **Administration** tab → **User Management** → **Secure Access**. ([docs.bluecatnetworks.com][4])
3. Under **General**, set `Server` (select Primary/Standby IP) and set `HTTPS` → **Enable** (or Redirect to HTTPS if desired).
4. Under **Server Certificate Settings** select **Custom**.
5. Click **Load Custom Certificate**. Then in **Upload Certificate**:

   * **Private Key**: click *Choose file* and upload `domain.key` (the key must be **PKCS#8**). If you uploaded an encrypted key, check **Use Password** and enter the password.
   * **Domain Signed Certificate**: choose `domain.crt` (PEM).
   * **Intermediate Bundle Certificate**: choose `ca-bundle.pem` (PEM containing the root and intermediate(s)). (BlueCat requires PEM format and the bundle must include the chain that matches the domain cert.) ([docs.bluecatnetworks.com][4])
6. Click **Update**. Confirm the changes in the confirm dialog.
7. The Address Manager will commit changes and restart; users will be logged out while restart completes. After restart, test the UI over HTTPS. ([docs.bluecatnetworks.com][4])

**Important notes:**

* Address Manager requires the private key be PKCS#8. If you upload a new private key it will overwrite any previously stored key in the Address Manager database. ([docs.bluecatnetworks.com][4])

---

# 6) If you need to update BlueCat Gateway (Gateway UI) instead

If your architecture uses BlueCat **Gateway** (BAM communications / front proxy) do this:

1. Log in to **BlueCat Gateway** → Administration → General Configuration → **Certificates**.
2. In the **Gateway** section, upload the TLS/SSL certificate as a `.crt` and the TLS/SSL key as a `.key` (Gateway expects no passphrase on the key).
3. For BAM communications, upload the CA root certificate (.crt) if requested.
4. Click **Save**. Uploading/replacing certificates will forcibly log out active sessions — plan a maintenance window. ([docs.bluecatnetworks.com][5])

---

# 7) Post-install tests (quick)

* Open a browser to the Address Manager domain -> ensure certificate shows the expected issuer and is valid for the hostname.
* Use curl to check TLS chain:

```bash
curl -vI https://address-manager.example.com/
```

* Check BlueCat logs for errors if the UI doesn’t come back up.

---

# 8) Troubleshooting & common gotchas

* **“Private key must comply with PKCS #8”**: convert with `openssl pkcs8` (see above). ([docs.bluecatnetworks.com][4])
* **Key not matching cert**: you’ll see errors — re-export/convert and validate modulus/public key as shown.
* **Encrypted key rejected by Gateway**: ensure the key is unencrypted for Gateway or use Address Manager UI which allows supplying the passphrase. ([docs.bluecatnetworks.com][5])
* **Venafi policy prevents private-key export**: ask your Venafi admin to either export PEM or provide a PFX or push the cert to the BlueCat host through an automated workflow. ([docs.venafi.com][2])
* **Backup**: always export / backup the current BlueCat cert & key before replacing (and schedule a maintenance window — sessions will be logged out). ([docs.bluecatnetworks.com][6])

---

# 9) Quick checklist (files you should end up with)

* `domain.crt` — PEM (leaf server certificate)
* `domain.key` — PEM **PKCS#8** private key (unencrypted for Gateway)
* `ca-bundle.pem` — PEM bundle containing intermediate(s) + root
* Optional: `cert.pfx` (PKCS#12) for backup/transport (password protected)

---

If you’d like, I can:

* give the exact `openssl` commands tailored to the filenames you have, or
* produce a small script you can run to convert a `.pfx` into the three files BlueCat expects, or
* walk through the BlueCat UI steps for your specific BlueCat version (tell me the exact Address Manager / Gateway version if you want the exact UI screenshots / steps).
