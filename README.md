Thanks! Based on your input, here’s the revised Subnet Reclaim Process that clearly indicates the network team depends on the ops team to reach out to application teams.

🔁 Subnet Reclaim Process (Final - With Ops Outreach to App Teams)

Overview:

A structured process to reclaim subnets that have been idle for over 90 days, involving coordination between Grafana/reporting, Network, Ops, and App Teams. The Ops team plays a key role in communicating with app teams for validation.

⸻

✅ Step-by-Step Procedure

⸻

Step 1: Daily Idle Subnet Report
	•	Generated by: Grafana team
	•	Shared with: Network team
	•	Report Includes:
	•	Subnet name, region, and project ID
	•	Subnet creation date and last usage/modification timestamp
	•	Flagged as idle >90 days

⸻

Step 2: Network Team Review and Shortlisting
	•	Network team analyzes the report:
	•	Filters out system or shared subnets
	•	Confirms initial inactivity criteria
	•	Creates a shortlist of subnets that appear reclaimable

⸻

Step 3: Network Team Engages Ops Team
	•	Network team shares the shortlisted subnet list with the Ops team
	•	Asks for help to:
	•	Identify the owning application teams
	•	Reach out to them for usage confirmation

⸻

Step 4: Ops Team Contacts Application Teams
	•	Ops team sends communication to app teams:
	•	Asks if the subnet is still in use
	•	Requests confirmation to delete or justification to retain
	•	Expected SLA: Response within 5 business days

⸻

Step 5: Intake Request Creation (If Reclaim Confirmed)
	•	Once the app team confirms the subnet is unused:
	•	Ops team raises an intake request in the Ops board
	•	Includes:
	•	Subnet details (name, region, project)
	•	App team confirmation (email/screenshot)
	•	Grafana report reference

⸻

Step 6: Final Validation by Network Team
	•	Network team validates:
	•	Subnet is not in use by active resources (Composer, GKE, etc.)
	•	No active routes or firewall dependencies
	•	Approves the reclaim request after checks

⸻

Step 7: Terraform Update and PR
	•	Ops team or assigned network engineer:
	•	Updates Terraform code to remove the subnet
	•	Raises a PR
	•	Gets it reviewed and merged

⸻

Step 8: Terraform Apply
	•	The changes are applied to GCP via CI/CD or manual apply
	•	Subnet is successfully removed

⸻

Step 9: Documentation and Closure
	•	Update:
	•	Central subnet tracker
	•	Project inventory (if maintained)
	•	Mark subnet as reclaimed
	•	Close the intake ticket with:
	•	PR link
	•	Final deletion confirmation

⸻

📌 Additional Notes:
	•	Reclaimable subnets may include those used for GKE/Composer where clusters no longer exist.
	•	Maintain a monthly tracker of:
	•	Subnet reclaim backlog
	•	App team follow-ups
	•	Subnet status post-deletion
