How Dataflow and Dataproc Manage Worker Nodes:

Dataflow:

Dynamically manages nodes via auto-scaling based on real-time workload demands.

Automatically scales up or down worker nodes.

Dataproc:

Uses YARN-based autoscaling to dynamically add or remove nodes according to predefined thresholds and workload.

Automatically provisions or removes worker nodes as required.

Composer 2 vs Composer 3 Resource Comparison:

Composer Version

GKE Nodes (Typical)

Pods per DAG Execution

DAG Count

Autoscaling Efficiency

Composer 2

Moderate (3-8 Nodes)

Moderate (5-12 Pods)

Moderate (5-12 DAGs)

Good

Composer 3

Higher (8-20 Nodes)

High (12-20 Pods)

High (10-20+ DAGs)

Excellent

Recommended Network Ranges:

Primary CIDR Range:

/23 subnet (512 IP addresses) or larger for general Composer resource provisioning (nodes, workers, services).

Secondary CIDR Ranges:

Pods: /21 (2046 IP addresses)

Services: /24 (254 IP addresses)

Best Practices:

Continuously monitor node usage, workload patterns, and autoscaling efficiency.

Adjust CIDR ranges proactively to avoid IP address exhaustion.

Apply consistent Composer tags for effective resource tracking, auditing, and cost management.
